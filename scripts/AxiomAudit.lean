# Axiom audit

arlib-community maintains arlib's hard invariant: **no declaration in the
library depends on any axiom beyond the three that Mathlib itself uses** —
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. In particular nothing depends on
`sorryAx`, so "no `sorry`" is checked semantically rather than by grepping for
the token.

Run it with

```bash
lake env lean scripts/AxiomAudit.lean
```

which exits non-zero if the invariant is broken. CI runs exactly this.

The roots are the `ArlibCommunity.*` declarations only. Everything reachable
from them is still traversed, so a violation inside arlib or Mathlib would be
caught; but arlib audits itself, and taking its declarations as roots here would
re-audit a dependency on every build.

The fast path is a single depth-first traversal from those roots, sharing one
`visited` set — linear in the size of the used environment, rather than one
`collectAxioms` call per declaration. Precise per-declaration attribution is
expensive, so it is only computed on the failure path, where the extra cost does
not matter.
