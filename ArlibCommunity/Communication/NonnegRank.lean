# Nonnegative rank, and `Par₁(F) ≥ rk⁺(F)`

The measure `Par_b^Π` of `Communication.Measures` counts rectangles; nonnegative
rank counts *nonnegative rank-one terms*, and is the weaker — hence more
robust — measure of the two.  It is the target of the nonnegative lifting
theorems, which is why it is worth having: a lower bound on `Par₁` obtained by
counting rectangles survives no approximation at all, whereas a lower bound on
nonnegative rank comes with an error parameter and still implies a rectangle
bound.  This file defines nonnegative rank in the idiom of the surrounding
development and proves the one inequality that connects it to what is already
here, Göös–Kiefer–Yuan `eq:una-nrank` ([GKY22, §3.3]):
a rectangular partition of `f⁻¹(1)` into `r` pieces *is* a decomposition of the
communication matrix of `f` into `r` nonnegative rank-one terms, so
`Par₁(F) ≥ rk⁺(F)`.

## Rank-one terms are pairs of local functions, not outer products of vectors

The source treats `F : X × Y → {0,1}` as a matrix and a rank-one term as an
outer product `u vᵀ` with `u ∈ ℝ_{≥0}^X`, `v ∈ ℝ_{≥0}^Y`
([GKY22, §3.3]).  Transcribing that literally here would
mean functions of *two* arguments, `(V → Bool) → (V → Bool) → ℝ`, and would
immediately fall out of step with everything around it: in this development
there is only one assignment `α : V → Bool`, and the partition `P : VarPartition Z`
is what says which of its coordinates belong to Alice and which to Bob.  A
matrix indexed by a *pair* of total assignments would have to be told, at every
use, to ignore `α` off `X` and `β` off `Y`, and the rectangle lemma upstream
produces nothing of that shape.

So a rank-one term is `NonnegRankOne P`: a pair of nonnegative functions
`left right : (V → Bool) → ℝ` carrying proofs that `left` depends only on the
variables of `P.X` and `right` only on those of `P.Y`, with value
`left α * right α` at `α`.  This is the same data as a pair of nonnegative
vectors indexed by the two blocks — a function on total assignments that is
constant along `P.Y` *is* a function on assignments to `P.X` — and it is the
exact real-valued analogue of `Rectangle`, whose two `_congr` fields have the
same job.  The dividend is that the crossing argument still works verbatim:
`NonnegRankOne.eval_cross` is `Rectangle.mem_cross` with `∧` replaced by `*`,
and it is proved the same way, one locality field per factor.

## Predicates indexed by `Fin r`, not a numeric rank

`HasNonnegRankOfSize P g r` says "`g` is a sum of `r` nonnegative rank-one
terms", indexed by `Fin r` for the reason given in the docstring of
`Communication.Rectangle`: the count is the index type, so it is fixed before
the family is produced and enlarging a decomposition is reindexing rather than
appending.  The numeric `rk⁺` is `sInf` of that predicate, and it is offered
here only alongside its two consumption lemmas, because `Nat.sInf` returns the
junk value `0` on the empty set — the hazard documented at length in
`Communication.Measures`.  Every statement that matters is available in the
predicate form, where the junk value cannot arise: the main theorem below is an
implication between two `Has…OfSize` predicates at the *same* `r`, and the
lower-bound direction that a proof actually consumes is its contrapositive,
`not_hasPartitionOfSize_of_not_hasNonnegRankOfSize`.  The `sInf` form
`fixedNonnegRank_le_fixedPar` is the literal `eq:una-nrank`, and it has to carry
a `Partitionable` hypothesis for exactly the reason `fixedCov_le_fixedPar` does.

## The approximate version, and one place the source is loose

`HasApproxNonnegRankOfSize P g ε r` asks for a sum of `r` nonnegative rank-one
terms within pointwise distance `ε` of `g`
([GKY22, §3.3]).  The source defines `rk⁺_ε(M)` as the
least `rk⁺(N)` over nonnegative `N` that `ε`-approximate `M`; here the
approximant is not named, only its decomposition, which is the same thing
unfolded — and the side condition that `N` be *nonnegative* is then automatic,
since a sum of nonnegative rank-one terms is nonnegative
(`HasNonnegRankOfSize.nonneg`).  Note also that the error is one-sided in
neither direction and is *absolute*, not relative, so `rk⁺_ε` is not monotone in
any useful sense in `ε` beyond `mono_eps` below; the source itself flags the
error parameter as badly behaved ([GKY22, §3.1]) and
tracks it by hand.

Two things in `eq:una-nrank` are deliberately not formalized.  The second
inequality `Una₁(F) ≥ log rk⁺(F)` is the first one with a logarithm applied,
and this area keeps everything in `ℕ` and never takes logarithms — see the
docstring of `Communication.Measures`, "Neither logarithms nor protocols".  And
the source's `F` is a `{0,1}`-matrix while `rk⁺` is defined for nonnegative real
matrices, so the inequality silently coerces; here the coercion is the explicit
`fiberIndicator`, and stating the theorem for a general fibre `b` rather than
only for `b = 1` costs nothing.

If `f⁻¹(b)` is partitioned into the `r` rectangles `R₁, …, R_r`, then the
communication matrix of `f` is the sum of the `r` nonnegative rank-one terms
`Mᵢ`, each `1` on `Rᵢ` and `0` elsewhere.  Both halves of `Partitions` are used
and neither can be dropped: the *cover* half gives that the sum is `1` wherever
`f α = b` and `0` elsewhere, and the *disjointness* half gives that it is `1`
and not more.  This is precisely why the source's inequality is about the
partition number `Par₁` and not about the cover number `Cov₁` — a mere cover
gives a decomposition of some function `≥ F`, not of `F`.

Stated as an implication between predicates at the same `r`, so that no minimum
and hence no junk value is involved; `fixedNonnegRank_le_fixedPar` is the
