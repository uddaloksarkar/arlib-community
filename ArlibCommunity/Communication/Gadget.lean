# Gadget composition: from a query problem to a communication problem

The construction that lifting theorems are about.  Given a Boolean function
`f` of `κ` variables and a two-party *gadget* `g` on `b + b` bits, the composed
function `f ∘ g^κ` has one gadget per variable of `f`: Alice holds the left `b`
bits of each gadget, Bob the right `b` bits, and the composed value is `f`
applied to the vector of gadget outputs.

Source: Göös–Kiefer–Yuan, *Lower Bounds for Unambiguous Automata via Communication
Complexity*, ICALP 2022 [GKY22, §3], "Nonnegative
lifting" and "Proof of Theorem 2".

## The variable type, and why the doubling is free

Variables are `Fin 2 × κ × Fin b`: a side, a coordinate of `f`, and a bit index.
Side `0` is Alice's, side `1` is Bob's, so the partition is by first component
and is *exactly* balanced.

The reason this is worth stating for a general `κ` rather than for `Fin n` is
that the union argument needs the composition of the **doubled** function
`f^∨(x,y) = f(x) ∨ f(y)`, which is a function of `κ ⊕ κ` variables.  Taking
`κ := ι ⊕ ι` in the definitions below therefore gives `F^∨ = f^∨ ∘ g^{ι ⊕ ι}`
with no separate construction and, crucially, with the partition still being
"Alice gets side `0`" — the four-block bookkeeping of the source's `L₁`, `L₂`
(`xx'yy'`, Alice holding `xx'`) is absorbed into the choice of `κ`.

The source writes `F^∨ = f^∨ ∘ g^n`; the exponent should be `2n`, since `f^∨`
has twice as many variables as `f`.  Under the reading here that discrepancy
disappears, because the exponent is the variable *type* and not a numeral.

## `composeGadget` is pointwise in `f`

Nothing below inspects `f`, so `composeGadget g` commutes with every Boolean
operation on `f`.  That is what makes `ψ ∨ φ` — the composition of the two
copies — equal to the composition of `f^∨`, which is the identity the whole
union argument turns on.
