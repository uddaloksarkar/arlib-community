# The uniform grid keep-coin (threshold realization)

`ReduceModel.keepAvg_of_cdf` reduces a coin-average obligation of the form
`E[keep | forget j] = threshold` to a single *CDF-exactness* hypothesis on the
keep-coin `j`:

  `hcdf :  ∀ ω,  ∑_c coinMass j c · [coinVal c < threshold ω]  =  threshold ω`.

A **fixed** finite coin cannot carry an ω-dependent bias, so a keep-decision
"fire with probability `threshold(ω)`" is realized instead by a **uniform grid
coin** plus the rule *fire iff the drawn value is below `threshold`*.  This
file proves the exactness of that scheme:

* `uniform_cdf_eq` — for the uniform coin on `Fin K` (mass `1/K`, value `c/K`),
  a threshold that is an *integer multiple* `m/K` (`m ≤ K`) of the grid step is
  realized **exactly**: `∑_c (1/K)·[c/K < m/K] = m/K`.
* `uniform_hcdf` — packaged as the `hcdf` hypothesis of `keepAvg_of_cdf`: any
  threshold whose every value is `K`-quantized (`= m/K`, `m ≤ K`) is realized by
  the uniform-`K` coin.

Any threshold that is a rational multiple of `1/K` for a common `K` can thus be
realized exactly by a uniform-`K` keep-coin.

No `sorry`; this file is pure grid arithmetic.

/-- **CDF-exactness of the uniform grid coin.**  For the uniform coin on `Fin K`
(each outcome mass `1/K`, value `coinVal c = c/K`), a threshold `m/K` with
`m ≤ K` is realized *exactly*: the probability of "fire iff value `< m/K`" equals
`m/K`.  Proof: the real comparison `c/K < m/K` is exactly `c < m` in `ℕ`, and
`{c : Fin K | c < m}` has `m` elements (it bijects with `range m` via `Fin.val`,
using `m ≤ K`), so the average is `m·(1/K)`. -/
