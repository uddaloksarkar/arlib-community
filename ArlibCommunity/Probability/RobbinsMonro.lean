# The Robbins–Monro condition `∑ aₙ = ∞`, and the deterministic recursion under it

The **deterministic** half of stochastic approximation.  Nothing in this module
mentions a probability space: it is real analysis about a single nonnegative
sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` of step sizes and the recursion it drives.

Two independent pieces:

## 1. What divergence buys you

* `tendsto_prod_one_sub_atTop_nhds_zero` — **the Robbins–Monro product lemma**:
  if `aₙ ∈ [0,1]` and `∑ aₙ = ∞` then `∏_{k<n} (1 − a_k) → 0`, via
  `1 − x ≤ exp (−x)`.  This is the mechanism by which a step-size schedule makes
  an iteration forget its initial condition, and it is the only place the
  divergence hypothesis is ever used.
* `detProc` — the deterministic auxiliary process `Y_{n+1} = (1 − aₙ)Yₙ + aₙ·c`,
  with `detProc_sub_const` (the closed form `Yₙ − c = (y₀ − c)∏(1 − a_k)`),
  `tendsto_detProc` (`Yₙ → c`), and the convexity bounds `le_detProc`,
  `detProc_le`.

## 2. How to establish divergence

Criteria for `∑_{t<n} α t → ∞` when the sequence is `0` almost everywhere and
only bounded below along a sparse set of "active" times — the situation in
asynchronous stochastic approximation, where a coordinate is updated only at the
times it is visited.

* `tendsto_sum_atTop_of_strictMono_harmonic_le` — a harmonic lower bound along a
  strictly monotone subsequence suffices; **no** hypothesis at all is placed on
  the sequence off that subsequence beyond nonnegativity.
* `tendsto_sum_atTop_of_count_harmonic_le` — the same, phrased by a *counter*:
  `p` holds infinitely often and `α t ≥ 1/(Nat.count p t + 1)` at every time `p`
  holds.  This is the form a visit-count-indexed schedule supplies directly.
* `setOf_infinite_of_forall_exists_le` — the bridge from "for every `N` there is
  a later active time" to `Set.Infinite`.

/-! ## 2. Criteria for `∑ α = ∞`

Nothing in this section mentions a probability space either.  The point of each
statement is that the sequence is constrained **only** along a sparse set of
times; off that set it may be `0`, which is the asynchronous case. -/

/-- **Divergence transfers along a strictly monotone subsequence.**

If `α ≥ 0` everywhere and `α (v k) ≥ 1/(k+1)` along a strictly monotone
`v : ℕ → ℕ`, then `∑_{t<n} α t → ∞`.

The proof is the sandwich
`∑_{i<m} 1/(i+1) ≤ ∑_{k<m} α (v k) = ∑_{t ∈ v''[0,m)} α t ≤ ∑_{t < v m} α t`:
the middle equality is `Finset.sum_image` at the injective `v`, the last
inequality is `Finset.sum_le_sum_of_subset_of_nonneg` at the inclusion
`v''[0,m) ⊆ [0, v m)` supplied by strict monotonicity, and the partial sums are
monotone because the terms are nonnegative, so unboundedness upgrades to
convergence to `atTop`.  Note that **no** lower bound whatsoever is assumed on
`α` off the range of `v`. -/

    _ ≤ ∑ t ∈ Finset.range (v m), α t :=
        Finset.sum_le_sum_of_subset_of_nonneg hsub fun i _ _ => hα i

/-- **The same, phrased by a counter rather than an enumeration.**

`p` holds at infinitely many times, and at every such time `t` the term `α t` is
at least `1/(N+1)` where `N = Nat.count p t` is the number of *earlier* times at
which `p` held.  Then `∑_{t<n} α t → ∞`.

This is the form an asynchronous schedule supplies: `p t` is "the coordinate is
the one updated at step `t`", `Nat.count p t` is its update counter, and the
bound is the harmonic schedule.  `Nat.nth p` is the strictly monotone enumeration
of `{t | p t}` (`Nat.nth_strictMono`), and `Nat.count_nth_of_infinite` says its
counter at the `k`-th occurrence is exactly `k`. -/
