# First-bad decomposition (exact "first occurrence in visitation order" identity)

For a finite family of events `E : ι → (P.Ω → Prop)` indexed by a `Finset s` carrying a
linear order (the *visitation order*), the probability of the union decomposes
*exactly* as the sum, over each `q`, of the probability of the "first-bad-at-`q`"
event `E q ∩ ⋂_{q' < q} (E q')ᶜ`:

  `Pr (⋃_{q∈s} E q) = ∑_{q∈s} Pr (E q ∩ {∀ q'∈s, q' < q → ¬ E q'})`.

This is the standard disjointification of a union along a linear order,
formalized purely at the abstract-probability (`ProbSpace`) level.  The
"prefix-good" event `firstBadPre s E q` is exactly `⋂_{q' < q} (E q')ᶜ`.  The
point of the identity is that it lets one bound each summand by the *stronger*
conditioned bound `Pr (E q ∩ prefix-good_q)` — restricting to the event that
every earlier index behaved well — instead of the unconditional `Pr (E q)`.

The exact additivity comes from linearity of the abstract expectation over the
*disjoint* first-bad pieces (`Ex_sum`): the indicator of the union equals the pointwise
sum of the pieces' indicators, so `Ex` distributes.  Admissibility of each piece
indicator is threaded through the `hpiece` hypothesis (auto over `FinProb`).

No `sorry`, no new axioms.

first-bad, since `firstBadPiece … q₂` demands `q₁` (which is `< q₂`) be good, while
`firstBadPiece … q₁` entails `E q₁`. -/

/-- **First-bad decomposition (exact identity).**  `Pr (⋃_{q∈s} E q)` equals the sum
over `q ∈ s` of the probability of the "first-bad-at-`q`" event
`E q ∩ firstBadPre s E q` (`= E q ∩ ⋂_{q'<q} (E q')ᶜ`).

The identity is exact linearity of `Ex` over the *disjoint* pieces: the indicator of the
union is the pointwise sum of the pieces' indicators, so `Ex_sum` applies (guarded by
`hpiece`, auto over `FinProb`). -/

/-- **First-bad bound.**  If each first-bad summand `Pr (E q ∩ firstBadPre s E q)` is
`≤ c q`, then `Pr (⋃_{q∈s} E q) ≤ ∑_{q∈s} c q`.  This is the identity above combined
with termwise monotonicity — the workhorse form that replaces the naive union bound
with the sharper "first-bad, on the prefix-good event" per-state bounds. -/
