# Coordinate-block independence over the mixed coin product (`MixedCoinSpace`)

The `MixedCoinSpace` analogue of `Probability/CoordIndep.lean`.  It ports **only
the exposed downstream surface** — events depending on pairwise-disjoint
coordinate blocks of the continuous coin product are (mutually) independent
(`ProbSpace.IndepEvents` over `C.toProbSpace`).  The finite-sum internals of
`CoordIndep` (`updOn`, `sum_forgetSet_cell`, `mass_updOn`,
`sum_prod_coinMass_block`, `condCE_forgetSet_full`) do **not** port: their role is
played by the already-proven integral primitives of `MixedCoinSpace`
(`condCE_forgetSet_fixed_rule`, `condCE_forgetSet_full`, `condCE_forgetSet_cond_Ex`).

**Route.**  As in the finite file, condition on forgetting one block.
`Pr[A ∩ B] = Ex[𝟙_A · 𝟙_B]`; the intersection indicator factors as a product
(`ind_inter`); conditioning on forgetting `B`'s block `U` (`condCE_forgetSet_cond_Ex`,
the keystone Fubini identity) and pulling the `U`-fixed factor `𝟙_A` out
(`condCE_forgetSet_fixed_rule`), then averaging `𝟙_B` over exactly its own block
(`condCE_forgetSet_full`, the marginal-of-a-block-function collapse), gives the
pairwise factorisation `Pr[A ∩ B] = Pr[A]·Pr[B]`.  A `Finset` induction lifts it
to mutual independence.

The finite positivity hypothesis `hpos : ∀ i c, 0 < coinMass i c` is replaced by
`BddMeas` (bounded-measurable) obligations on the event indicators: on this
probability measure the mass is automatically one (no positivity needed), and the
only extra input over the finite model is the **measurability of the events**
(carried through `BddMeas (indic (E i))`).

agree on `U`.  (Same shape as `CoinSpace.EventDepOn`, adapted to `C.Ω`.) -/

/-- `Pr[A] = Ex[𝟙_A]` for the mixed product space (unfolding `ProbSpace.Pr` of

/-! ### Pairwise factorisation -/

/-- **Pairwise factorisation.**  Events on disjoint coordinate blocks are
independent: `Pr[A ∩ B] = Pr[A]·Pr[B]`.  The finite `hpos` is replaced by
`BddMeas` on the two indicators (indicators are bounded; measurability of the
events is the genuine extra hypothesis over the finite model).  Proof: the
integral factorises via `condCE_forgetSet_cond_Ex` (keystone Fubini),
`condCE_forgetSet_fixed_rule` (pull the fixed factor out), and
`condCE_forgetSet_full` (average the other over its own block). -/

/-! ### Almost-everywhere pairwise factorisation -/

/-- **Almost-everywhere pairwise factorisation.**  A weakening of
`Pr_inter_eq_mul` that only needs the two events to *agree almost everywhere* with
events `A'`, `B'` living on disjoint coordinate blocks.  This is the tool for the
`#DNNF` `×`-child independence, where the two children read a genuinely shared
(but almost-surely non-influential) block of variable-free coins: replacing the
child indicators by their non-shared restrictions (equal a.e.) makes the blocks
disjoint, and `integral_congr_ae` transports the factorisation back.

Concretely: given `indic A =ᵐ indic A'` and `indic B =ᵐ indic B'` with
`A' EventDepOn T`, `B' EventDepOn U`, `Disjoint T U`, the product expectation
`E[𝟙_A · 𝟙_B]` factors as `E[𝟙_A] · E[𝟙_B]`. -/
