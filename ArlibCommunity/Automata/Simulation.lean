# Protocols can simulate automata

The bridge between the two halves of Göös–Kiefer–Yuan, *Lower Bounds for
Unambiguous Automata via Communication Complexity*: an automaton reading a word
`x y` that has been cut at a fixed position *is* a two-party protocol, and the
only thing that has to cross the cut is the name of the state the automaton is
in when it gets there.  Hence a bound on the number of states bounds a
rectangle count.  Two lemmas, with the same one-line construction:

* `NFA.hasTPCover_of_nfa` — the paper's `lem:NFA-CC`
  ([GKY22, `lem:NFA-CC`]): an NFA with `s` states gives
  `Cov₁(F) ≤ s`.
* `NFA.hasTPPartition_of_ufa` — the paper's `lem:UFA-CC`
  ([GKY22, `lem:UFA-CC`]): a UFA with `s` states gives
  `Par₁(F) ≤ s`.

Both are used in the *contrapositive* direction downstream: a lower bound on
`Cov₁` or `Par₁` of a lifted function becomes a lower bound on the number of
states of any (U)FA for the corresponding language
([GKY22, §2.2],
[GKY22, §3.4]).

## The rectangles

The construction is displayed at [GKY22, §2.1]:
`F⁻¹(1)` is the union, over states `q`, of the rectangle whose left side is the
`x` from which some initial state reaches `q`, and whose right side is the `y`
from which `q` reaches an accepting state.  Here that is `NFA.simLeft`,
`NFA.simRight` and `NFA.simRect`, and the two inclusions are
`NFA.accepts_of_mem_simRect` and `NFA.exists_mem_simRect_of_accepts` — the
`isRun_append` splitting lemma of `Automata.Basic` read in each direction.

Several states may well give the *empty* rectangle (no `x` reaches `q`, or `q`
reaches nothing accepting).  That is harmless: a cover is allowed empty members,
and it is why the bound is `≤ s` rather than `= s`.

## Why the partition proof is not literally "the same"

The paper says `lem:UFA-CC` is "proved the same way"
([GKY22, §3.3]), and the *family* of rectangles is indeed
the same one.  The disjointness is not immediate, and the gap is worth spelling
out because it is exactly where the hypotheses are used.

Unambiguity ([GKY22, §1.4]) says a word has at most
one accepting *run*.  Membership of `(x, y)` in two rectangles `q ≠ q'` produces
two accepting runs on `x ++ y`, so unambiguity makes the two runs equal — as
lists of states.  It does **not** directly say that the two runs agree *at the
cut*, because a priori the two decompositions could split the one common run at
two different places.  They cannot, and the reason is a fact about the *inputs*
rather than the automaton: `x` has length `m₁` on the nose, so both left factors
are runs over the same word and hence have the same length
(`NFA.IsRun.length`), and `List.append_inj` then forces the left factors to be
equal, whence the cut states are.  This is `NFA.simCutState_unique`, and it is
the only place the length constraint carried by `WordsOfLen` is used at all.

So the fixed lengths are not bookkeeping: without them the union in
`lem:NFA-CC` is still a cover, but the family need not be a partition.

## `WordsOfLen`, and the shape of the hypothesis

Alice's and Bob's inputs are `{w : List σ // w.length = m}`, a subtype rather
than `Fin m → σ` or `Mathlib.Vector`, because every use in the proofs is
`x.val ++ y.val`: the automaton consumes a `List σ`, and any other encoding
would spend the whole file converting.  The length proof is carried along only
for `simCutState_unique`.

The link between the automaton and the two-party function is a hypothesis

    hA : ∀ x y, A.Accepts (x.val ++ y.val) ↔ F x y = true

rather than an equation `A.language = {x y | F x y}`.  The paper's phrasing
([GKY22, §2.1]) identifies `F` with the language
`{xy ∈ {0,1}^{m₁+m₂} | F(x,y) = 1}`, which would additionally force `A` to
reject every word whose length is not `m₁ + m₂`.  Nothing in the argument needs
that, and downstream automata (products with length counters, say) are more
convenient to build without it, so the hypothesis constrains `A` only on split
words.  `WordsOfLen.append_inj` records that this identification loses nothing:
a word of length `m₁ + m₂` determines its two halves, so the language really
does determine `F`.

## Counts, not logarithms

The paper states these lemmas as `Non₁(F) ≤ log s` and `Una₁(F) ≤ log s`.  We
bound `tpCov` and `tpPar` by `Fintype.card Q` directly, per the area convention
that measures are counts; the logarithm is a cosmetic step that would only add
a positivity side condition.  The index type of the rectangle family is
`Fin (Fintype.card Q)` via `Fintype.equivFin`, which is noncomputable — so
`NFA.simFamily` is too.  Nothing downstream evaluates it.

([GKY22, §2.1]).  It is not needed for either

/-- **Alice's side of the rectangle at `q`**: the inputs `x` from which some
initial state reaches `q`, i.e. the paper's
`{x | ∃ q₀ ∈ I . q₀ --x--> q}` ([GKY22, §2.1]).

Phrased with an explicit run `rs` rather than with `Reach`, even though for the
cover lemma `Reach` would do.  The partition lemma has to compare *runs* across
the cut — unambiguity is a statement about runs, not about endpoints — and using
one predicate for both lemmas keeps `simRect` a single definition. -/

  ∃ q₀ rs, A.start q₀ ∧ A.IsRun q₀ x.val rs ∧ lastState q₀ rs = q

/-- **Bob's side of the rectangle at `q`**: the inputs `y` from which `q`
reaches an accepting state, the paper's `{y | ∃ f ∈ F . q --y--> f}`
([GKY22, §2.1]). -/

/-- **The rectangle at `q`**, `simLeft q × simRight q`.

In protocol terms ([GKY22, §2.1]): Alice guesses
a run for `x` from an initial state to `q` and sends the name of `q`; Bob
guesses a run for `y` from `q` to an accepting state.  The name of `q` is the
entire message, which is why the number of rectangles is the number of
states. -/

/-! ## The two inclusions -/

/-- **Every rectangle is inside `F⁻¹(1)`.**  Alice's run over `x` and Bob's run
over `y` concatenate to an accepting run over `x ++ y`; this is `isRun_append`
read from right to left. -/

/-- **`F⁻¹(1)` is inside the union of the rectangles.**  An accepting run over
`x ++ y` splits at the cut, and the state it is in there is the index of a
rectangle containing `(x, y)`; this is `isRun_append` read from left to right. -/

/-! ## Disjointness, for a UFA -/

/-- **The state at the cut is determined**, when `A` is unambiguous: a pair
`(x, y)` lies in at most one of the rectangles.

This is the step the paper does not spell out ([GKY22, §3.3]
says only "proved the same way as `lem:NFA-CC`").  Unambiguity equates the two
accepting runs on `x ++ y` *as lists*; to conclude that they agree at the cut one
still needs that the two left factors have the same length, which holds because
both are runs over `x.val` — and that is the only use in this file of the fact
that Alice's input has a prescribed length. -/

/-! ## The simulation lemmas -/

/-- **The family of rectangles, indexed by `Fin (Fintype.card Q)`.**

Reindexing `simRect` along `Fintype.equivFin`, since `TPCovers` and
`TPPartitions` take families over `Fin k` — the index type *is* the count, so
that "there is a cover of size `k`" is a predicate on `k` with no side
condition.  `Fintype.equivFin` is noncomputable, hence so is this. -/
