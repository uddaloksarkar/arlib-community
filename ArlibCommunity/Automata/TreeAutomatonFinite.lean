# Finite tree automata

`Arlib.Automata.TreeAutomaton` deliberately carries no finiteness: `init` and
`step` are `Prop`-valued, the state type is arbitrary, and `LTree` allows
unbounded branching.  That is the right definition for a *reduction*, which
should be able to emit an automaton with no proof obligations at all.  It is
not the definition a *counting* result is stated for.  A source paper's tree
automaton is a tuple `(S, Σ, Δ, s_init)` with `S` a finite set of states, `Σ` a
finite alphabet and `Δ ⊆ S × Σ × (⋃_{i=0}^k S^i)`, running on the `k`-ary trees
`Trees_k[Σ]`; a counting problem `#TA` over *all* `TreeAutomaton`s is a strictly
stronger problem than the one such a paper solves.

This file supplies the missing side conditions, as a predicate rather than as a
change to the structure, and proves the facts that make the predicate usable.

## The three side conditions, and why they are about the *reachable* part

`IsFinite A k` asks for

* finitely many **reachable** states,
* finitely many labels **used at reachable states**,
* every transition **out of a reachable state** naming at most `k` children.

Restricting all three to the reachable part is forced, not a convenience.  A
reduction that indexes its states by "a node of the input tree, plus a partial
assignment" produces a `step` relation that is defined — and true — at states
sitting at nodes of trees that are not the input at all; there is no bound on
the arity of *those*, and there are a proper class of them.  What an algorithm
emitting the automaton writes down is exactly the reachable part, and the
reachable part is all the language sees.  `Reachable` is the least set
containing the initial states and closed under `step`.

The gap this leaves is closed by `TreeAutomaton.restrict`: it cuts `A` down to
its reachable states, giving an automaton on the type `↥A.reachableStates` —
genuinely `Finite` under `IsFinite`, and on which the arity bound holds at
*every* state of the type, with no reachability side condition.  So the paper's
tuple really is available, with the same language and the same size slices.

The alphabet is *not* re-indexed.  Doing so would change the type of the trees,
from `LTree Γ` to `LTree ↥A.usedLabels`, and so would change `langOfSize` from
an equality into a bijection.  What is proved instead is
`labelsIn_of_mem_lang`: every accepted tree already has all of its labels in
the finite set `A.usedLabels`, so the automaton is one over a finite alphabet in
every sense except the literal type.

## Main definitions

* `LTree.LabelsIn Λ t`, `LTree.DegreeLE k t` — every label of `t` lies in `Λ`;
  every node of `t` has at most `k` children.  `DegreeLE k` is membership in
  `Trees_k[Γ]`.
* `LTree.boundedSet Λ k n` — the trees with labels in `Λ`, degree `≤ k` and
  size `≤ n`.
* `TreeAutomaton.Reachable`, `TreeAutomaton.reachableStates`,
  `TreeAutomaton.usedLabels` — the part of an automaton a constructor emits.
* `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite A k` — the three side conditions.
* `TreeAutomaton.restrict` — `A` on the state type `↥A.reachableStates`.

## Main results

* `LTree.finite_boundedSet` — **finitely many labels, bounded degree and
  bounded size give finitely many trees.**  No decidability and no `Fintype` is
  assumed; the proof is an induction on the size bound, and the only input is
  `Set.Finite` of the label set.
* `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite.singleInit` — the side conditions survive the
  collapse of a set of initial states to one.
* `TreeAutomaton.degreeLE_of_mem_lang` — every accepted tree is `k`-ary, i.e.
  `L(A) ⊆ Trees_k[Γ]`.
* `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite.langOfSize_finite` — **`L_n(A)` is finite**, which is
  what makes `|L_n(A)|` a number and `#TA` a counting problem at all.
* `TreeAutomaton.langOfSize_restrict`, `TreeAutomaton.finite_restrict_state`,
  `TreeAutomaton.restrict_step_length_le` — the re-indexing onto a genuinely
  finite state type, preserving every size slice.

— one of finitely many — together with its list of children, which has length at
most `k` and whose entries all lie in the (inductively finite) set of trees of
size at most `n`; `finite_lists_over` bounds those.

No decidability of `Λ` and no `Fintype` on `Γ` is used: the hypothesis is

/-! ### The finiteness predicate -/

`A.IsFinite k` says that the automaton an algorithm would emit for `A` — its
reachable part — is the tuple `(S, Σ, Δ, S₀)` of the classical definition, with
`S` finite, `Σ` finite and `Δ ⊆ S × Σ × (⋃_{i=0}^k S^i)`.

All three clauses are relative to reachability; see the module docstring for why
that is forced, and `restrict` for the construction that removes the
qualification. -/

/-! ### Preservation by `singleInit` -/

/-- Every state reachable in `singleInit A` is either the fresh initial state or
an old state that was reachable in `A`.  This is `accepts_some_iff` at the level
of states: every transition of `singleInit A` tags all of its child states, so
the fresh state occurs at the root and nowhere else. -/

themselves reachable. -/

/-- **The side conditions survive the collapse of the initial states to one.**

`singleInit` adds a single state and copies the transitions out of `S₀`, so it
adds one to `|S|`, nothing to `|Σ|` and nothing to the arity.  Together with
`langOfSize_singleInit` this is what lets a reduction that naturally produces a
set of initial states hand its automaton to a result stated for
single-initial-state automata *without* giving up finiteness. -/

not a number.  It is the conjunction of the three side conditions — finitely
many states is not used directly, but finitely many *labels*, bounded degree and
bounded size are, and finiteness of the alphabet is exactly what the reachable
state bound delivers in practice.

suffices. -/

/-- **`A` cut down to its reachable states.**

The state type becomes the subtype `↥A.reachableStates`, which is `Finite` as
soon as `A.IsFinite k` holds (`finite_restrict_state`), and on which the arity
bound holds at *every* state with no reachability side condition
(`restrict_step_length_le`).  So `restrict A` is a tree automaton in the
classical sense — a finite state set, a bounded-arity transition relation — and
`langOfSize_restrict` says it has the same size slices as `A`, hence the same
`#TA` answers. -/
