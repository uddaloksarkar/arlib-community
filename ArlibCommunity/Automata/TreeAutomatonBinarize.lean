# Binarising a tree automaton

`Arlib.Automata.TreeAutomatonOps` formalises the *tree*-level half of the
first-child/next-sibling encoding: `LTree.toBinary` and its inverse
`LTree.ofBinary`, the size identity `size_toBinary`, and the bijection
`LTree.equivEncoded` onto the decodable binary trees.  It stops there, with the
remark that "the automaton-level construction — pushing `𝒯` through the encoding
— is a follow-on to these lemmas and is not attempted here."

This file is that follow-on, and with it the source paper's `lem-tata` — quoted
entirely to TATA, with no proof — becomes a theorem:

> there is a polynomial-time algorithm turning a tree automaton `𝒯` over
> unranked trees into a tree automaton `𝒯'` over binary trees with
> `|{t ∈ L(𝒯) : |t| = n}| = |{t' ∈ L(𝒯') : |t'| = 2n − 1}|` for every `n ≥ 1`.

## The construction

Recall the encoding: `a(t₁,…,t_k)` becomes the left comb
`@(…@(@(a, t₁′), t₂′)…, t_k′)`.  Read *top-down* — the direction a
`TreeAutomaton` runs in — this comb is peeled from the **outside in**, so the
children of the original node are met in the order `t_k, t_{k−1}, …, t₁`, and
the label `a` is met last, at the leaf on the left spine.

That dictates the state set.  `binarize A` has states `S ⊕ (Γ × List S)`:

* `Sum.inl q` — "this binary tree is the encoding of a tree accepted by `A`
  from `q`";
* `Sum.inr (a, us)` — "this binary tree is the comb of a node labelled `a`
  whose children are accepted from `us`, *in order*", i.e. it is
  `@(…@(a, t₁′)…, t_j′)` with `us = [q₁,…,q_j]` and `A.Accepts qᵢ tᵢ`.

The transitions out of `Sum.inr (a, us)` are `CombStep`: strip the last state
`q` off `us` and split into `[Sum.inr (a, us'), Sum.inl q]` under the label `@`,
or, when `us` is empty, halt at the leaf `Sum.inl a`.  The transitions out of
`Sum.inl q` are: *guess* a transition `A.step q a us` of the original automaton
and then behave like `Sum.inr (a, us)`.  Guessing the whole transition at the
root of the comb is what lets the spine states carry only `(a, us)` — the
transition is checked once, and the peeling afterwards is bookkeeping.

Only states `Sum.inr (a, us')` with `us'` a prefix of the right-hand side of
some transition of `A` are ever reachable (`step_binarize_inr_iff` makes the
peeling explicit), so for an automaton of arity at most `k` with `|Δ|`
transitions the construction uses at most `|S| + (k+1)|Δ|` states and
`|Δ| + (k+1)|Δ|` transitions: linear in `|A|` for fixed `k`, a fortiori
polynomial.  Since `Arlib.Approximation.Counting` fixes no model of computation,
that count is not *proved* here; it appears, as everywhere else in
`Arlib.Approximation`, as the explicit `PolyBounded` hypotheses of the transfer
theorems below.

## The `2n − 1` of the paper

The paper's slice statement is `|L_n(𝒯)| = |L_{2n−1}(𝒯')|`, hedged with
`n ≥ 1`.  `LTree.size_toBinary` already gives `|t′| = 2|t| − 1` pointwise, and
`size_toBinary_eq_iff` shows the reparameterisation is an *equivalence*, not
merely an implication: `|toBinary t| = 2n − 1 ↔ |t| = n`.  The side condition
`n ≥ 1` is unnecessary — at `n = 0` both slices are empty, since every tree has
at least one node and `2·0 − 1 = 0` in truncated `ℕ` subtraction.  So
`langOfSize_binarize` and `ncard_langOfSize_binarize` hold for *every* `n`.

A related sanity check the paper raises in a comment and does not settle:
`odd_size_toBinary` records that every encoded tree has odd size, so the slices
of `𝒯'` at even sizes are empty and no information is lost by only ever asking
about `2n − 1`.

## Main results

* `LTree.size_toBinary_eq_iff`, `LTree.odd_size_toBinary` — the size relation.
* `LTree.IsBinary`, `LTree.isBinary_toBinary` — the target model
  `Trees_b[Σ ∪ {@}]`, and the fact that the encoding lands in it.
* `TreeAutomaton.binarize`, `TreeAutomaton.CombStep` — the construction.
* `TreeAutomaton.step_binarize_children`,
  `TreeAutomaton.isBinary_of_mem_lang_binarize` — `binarize A` *is* a binary
  tree automaton, syntactically and semantically.
* `TreeAutomaton.accepts_inl_iff_toBinary` — a run of `binarize A` from
  `Sum.inl q` is exactly an encoded run of `A` from `q`.
* `TreeAutomaton.lang_binarize` — `L(binarize A) = toBinary '' L(A)`.
* `TreeAutomaton.langOfSize_binarize`,
  `TreeAutomaton.ncard_langOfSize_binarize` — **`lem-tata`**.
* `TreeAutomaton.finsetEncodeEquiv` — the decoding bijection on solution sets,
  built from `LTree.ofBinary`.
* `TreeAutomaton.isFPRAS_of_binary`, `TreeAutomaton.isFPAUS_of_binary`,
  `TreeAutomaton.binarizeReduction` — **`cor:fpras-ta-bta`**.

`size_toBinary` gives `→` by rewriting; the content here is `←`, which needs
`size_pos`: from `|t′| = 2n − 1` alone one recovers `|t| = n` only because
`|t| ≥ 1` rules out the degenerate solution of `2|t| − 1 = 2n − 1` in truncated
arithmetic.  No `n ≥ 1` hypothesis is required — at `n = 0` both sides are
false. -/

The paper's target model is `Trees_b[Σ ∪ {@}]`: trees in which "every node has
two children or is a leaf", explicitly distinguished there from `2`-trees, in
which a node may have a single child.  `LTree` is unranked, so the restriction
is a predicate rather than a type. -/

/-- **A binary tree**: every node has either no children or exactly two.  This
is the paper's `Trees_b[Σ]`, and it is a strictly stronger condition than being
a `2`-tree, which would also allow a node with one child. -/

/-! ### The construction -/

/-- One step down the left comb of an encoded node.

`CombStep a us c cs` says that a binary node labelled `c` with children states
`cs` is a legal move for the spine state `(a, us)`, where `us` lists the states
assigned to the children of the original node that are still to be met:

* if `us` is empty the comb has bottomed out and the node must be the leaf
  `Sum.inl a`, with no children;
* otherwise `us = us' ++ [q]`, the node is the application symbol
  `Sum.inr ()`, its right child is the encoding of the *last* child of the
  original node — handed the state `Sum.inl q` — and its left child is the rest
  of the comb, handed `Sum.inr (a, us')`.

The list is consumed from the right because a left comb is peeled from the
outside in. -/
def CombStep (a : Γ) (us : List S) (c : Γ ⊕ Unit) (cs : List (S ⊕ Γ × List S)) : Prop :=
  (us = [] ∧ c = Sum.inl a ∧ cs = []) ∨
    ∃ (us' : List S) (q : S),
      us = us' ++ [q] ∧ c = Sum.inr () ∧ cs = [Sum.inr (a, us'), Sum.inl q]

/-- The transition relation of `binarize A`.  A spine state `Sum.inr (a, us)`
peels the comb; an original state `Sum.inl q` first guesses a transition
`A.step q a us` of `A` and then peels the comb it describes. -/

  | .inl q, c, cs => ∃ (a : Γ) (us : List S), A.step q a us ∧ CombStep a us c cs
  | .inr (a, us), c, cs => CombStep a us c cs

/-- The initial states of `binarize A`: the tagged initial states of `A`.  No
spine state is initial, since the root of an encoding is the top of the comb of
the root of the original tree, which is entered from `Sum.inl`. -/

  | .inl q => A.init q

/-- **The binarisation of a tree automaton.**  `binarize A` runs over binary
trees labelled by `Γ ⊕ Unit`, with `Sum.inr ()` playing the role of the paper's
fresh application symbol `@`, and accepts exactly the `LTree.toBinary`-encodings
of the trees accepted by `A` (`lang_binarize`).

The state set `S ⊕ (Γ × List S)` adds, to the states of `A`, one *spine* state
per pair (label, prefix of the right-hand side of a transition); the transitions
are one per transition of `A` plus one per such prefix.  This is the
construction the source paper cites to TATA without giving it. -/

some spine state `Sum.inr (a, us)` whose `(a, us)` is a transition of `A` at

/-! ### Decoding a solution

The paper's `cor:fpras-ta-bta` asserts in passing that "given a binary tree
`t′ ∈ L_n(𝒯′)` after the reduction … the corresponding original tree
`t ∈ L_n(𝒯)` can be reconstructed in polynomial time".  `LTree.ofBinary` *is*
that reconstruction, and the bijection below is built from it rather than from
`Classical.choice`, so the decoding is proved and not merely asserted to
exist. -/

/-- On a finset of binary trees that consists of encodings, `LTree.ofBinary`
always succeeds. -/

almost-uniform sampler for binary tree automata yields one for general tree
automata: a sample of `p'` is *decoded* into a sample of `p`, by
`LTree.ofBinary`, with `LTree.ofBinary_toBinary` and `LTree.toBinary_ofBinary`
as the two round-trip proofs. -/

/-! ### `cor:fpras-ta-bta`: transferring an FPRAS and an FPAUS

The counting problem `#TA` takes a tree automaton together with a size `n` in
unary and asks for `|L_n(𝒯)|`; `#BTA` is the same problem restricted to binary
tree automata.  The reduction is `binarizeInstance`, and it is parsimonious once
the size parameter is reparameterised by `n ↦ 2n − 1`.

As everywhere in `Arlib.Approximation`, "polynomial time" is not a property of a
Lean term: the cost of the reduction and the size of its output enter as
explicit `PolyBounded` hypotheses, discharged by whoever fixes a machine model
and an encoding of automata.  What is *proved* here is everything else — that
the reduction preserves the count on the nose, and that a sample can be decoded
back. -/
