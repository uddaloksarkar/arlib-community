# Witnesses for `SuccinctNFA.Encoding` and `Definition def:prop`

`SuccinctNFA.Encoding` and `SuccinctNFA.LabelProps` are hypothesis bundles: they
occur to the *left* of the turnstile in `Encoding.memberTest`, in the source's
`thm:progmain`, and in everything the `CQCount` development builds on top of
them.  A hypothesis bundle that nothing satisfies makes every theorem about it
true and worthless, and the failure is invisible — no proof breaks, no `sorry`
appears.  This file removes that possibility by exhibiting instances.

## The instance

`witnessNFA` is the two-state automaton `0 --A--> 1` over `Γ = Fin 3` with
`L = Bool`:

* `decode true = {0, 1}` — the used label, decoding to **two** symbols;
* `decode false = ∅` — an *unused* label, present in `L` but on no transition.

`witnessOracle` answers for it, and `labelProps_witness` proves
`LabelProps witnessNFA witnessOracle (1/2) 1 2`.  `witnessEncoding` is the
matching `Encoding`, of size `4`, and `witness_memberTest` instantiates
`Encoding.memberTest` — the source's `prop:membertest` — at the pair, so that
proposition too is known to have a model.

## What the witness exercises, clause by clause

The point of a witness is defeated if every clause holds for a degenerate
reason, so each is accounted for here.

**Genuinely exercised, and tight — the parameters `(ε₀, g, T) = (1/2, 1, 2)`
cannot be improved in any coordinate:**

* `sampler_uniform`.  `decode true` has **two distinct** elements, `0` and `1`,
  and the sampler is deliberately **non-uniform**: it returns `0` with
  probability `1/4` and `1` with probability `3/4`, against a target of
  `1/|A| = 1/2`.  Both endpoints of the window `[(1−ε₀)/2, (1+ε₀)/2] = [1/4, 3/4]`
  are attained (`witness_sampler_uniform_tight`), so the clause is an equality
  constraint at both ends rather than a `p = p`.  `labelProps_witness_le_eps`
  turns this around: no `ε₀ < 1/2` works, whatever `g` and `T`.
* `sizeBound`.  `|decode true| = 2 = 2 ^ 1`, so the bound holds with equality;
  `labelProps_witness_le_g` shows `g = 0` fails.
* `memCost_le` and `sampler_cost`.  Membership costs exactly `2 = T`, and the
  sampler's two support points cost `1` and `2`; `labelProps_witness_le_T`
  shows `T = 1` fails.
* `memTest_correct`.  `memTest true` is `a ≠ 2`, which is `true` on `0, 1` and
  `false` on `2`, so both directions of the `↔` have content: `decode true` is a
  **proper** subset of `Γ`, and a test that always said `true` would fail.
* `sampler_mem`.  `2 ∉ decode true`, and the sampler must and does avoid it.
  The guard `(decode true).Nonempty` is discharged, not exploited, so the clause
  is checked and not skipped: `witness_sampler_mem_unguarded` states the
  unguarded form separately.
* `UsedLabel` is not vacuous: `witnessNFA_usedLabel_true` holds, so every clause
  above is actually reached.  And it is not trivial either —
  `witnessNFA_not_usedLabel_false` shows `false` is *not* used, which is what
  lets `witnessOracle` answer nonsense there (`est false = 17`, a sampler
  returning `2` at cost `7`) without breaking anything.  That is the `UsedLabel`
  guard doing its job.

**Holds degenerately, and could not do otherwise:**

* `finite`.  `Γ = Fin 3` is a finite type, so every subset is finite.  No choice
  of witness over a finite alphabet can exercise this clause; it exists for
  alphabets that are not finite types.
* `est_relErr`.  `est true = 5/2` sits strictly inside `[1, 3]`, so the clause is
  satisfied with slack.  This is deliberate: making it tight would make `ε₀`
  overdetermined and hide which clause is really pinning `ε₀ = 1/2`.

## The empty-label case, and why `sampler_mem` is guarded

`deadNFA` is the same shape with a single label decoding to `∅` — a dead
transition, which nothing in the model forbids.  `labelProps_dead` proves
`LabelProps deadNFA deadOracle 0 0 0`, and
`not_unguarded_sampler_mem_dead` proves that **no** oracle whatsoever satisfies
the *unguarded* form of `sampler_mem` on it, because a `PMF` has nonempty
support.  The pair is the proof that the `(N.decode A).Nonempty` guard on
`LabelProps.sampler_mem` is load-bearing and not decoration: without it the
bundle is not merely awkward on `deadNFA`, it is empty, and every theorem taking
it as a hypothesis would say nothing there.
