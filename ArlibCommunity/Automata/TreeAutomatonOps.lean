# Normalising constructions on tree automata

Two constructions that a source paper asserts and does not prove, and that a
reduction into `#TA` needs before it can quote a "tree automaton" result off
the shelf.

## Construction 1: collapsing a set of initial states to one

`TreeAutomaton` carries a *set* `init : S → Prop` of initial states, which is
the form in which a reduction naturally produces an automaton — the CQ
reduction builds an automaton whose root may start in any of a family of
states.  The definition of a tree automaton that the counting results are
stated for has a *single* initial state.  The source paper bridges the gap with
the remark that a set of initial states "can be translated in polynomial time
into a tree automaton with a single initial state", and leaves it there.

`singleInit` is that translation: add one fresh state `none`, and give it a
copy of every transition available at *some* initial state.  It adds one state
and at most `|Δ|` transitions, so it is linear, a fortiori polynomial.

The content is `lang_singleInit`, and its `n`-slice refinement
`langOfSize_singleInit`.  Both rest on `accepts_some_iff`, which says the
embedding `some : S → Option S` is an isomorphism onto the old behaviour: the
fresh state is unreachable from any `some s`, because every transition of
`singleInit A` sends `some`-states to its children.  That last clause is why
the transition relation is phrased as

    ∃ ss, qs = ss.map some ∧ …

rather than as a condition on `qs` pointwise: it makes "all children are old
states, and they run as they used to" a single rewrite.

Note that the slice statement `langOfSize_singleInit` is what a *parsimonious*
reduction needs.  Preserving `L(A)` is not by itself enough — the counting
problem is parameterised by size, so the translation must not disturb sizes
either.  Here it does not, because it does not touch trees at all.

## Construction 2: unranked trees to binary trees

The other assertion — the paper's `lem-tata`, credited to TATA and stated
without proof — is that a tree automaton over unranked trees of arity `≤ k` can
be turned in polynomial time into one over *binary* trees with

    |{t ∈ L(𝒯) : |t| = n}| = |{t' ∈ L(𝒯') : |t'| = 2n − 1}| .

The mathematical content is the tree encoding, and that is what is formalised
here: `toBinary` is the first-child/next-sibling encoding, in the "`@`-extension"
presentation.  A node `a(t₁,…,t_k)` becomes the left-combed application

    @(@(…@(a, t₁′)…), t_k′)

over the alphabet `Γ ⊕ Unit`, with `Sum.inr ()` playing the role of `@`.  Every
node of `t` becomes a leaf `Sum.inl a`, and every *edge* of `t` becomes an
internal `@`-node, so the encoding of an `n`-node tree is a full binary tree
with `n` leaves and `n − 1` internal nodes — hence `2n − 1` nodes.  This is
`size_toBinary`, stated primarily in the addition form
`(toBinary t).size + 1 = 2 * t.size` because `2 * n - 1` is truncated
subtraction in `ℕ`; the subtraction form is derived from it.

Bijectivity is `ofBinary_toBinary` (a left inverse, hence injectivity) together
with `toBinary_ofBinary` (a right inverse wherever `ofBinary` succeeds).  The
two combine into `equivEncoded`, a genuine `Equiv` between `LTree Γ` and the
subtype of binary trees that decode.  Injectivity plus the size identity is
what the counting identity above rests on: `ncard_image_toBinary` records the
resulting cardinality statement for an arbitrary set of trees, and
`ncard_image_langOfSize` instantiates it at the slice `L_n(A)`, whose image
consists entirely of trees of size `2n − 1`.

A remark on the paper's bookkeeping.  Its reduction is called parsimonious, but
it is a bijection only *after* the reparameterisation `n ↦ 2n − 1`; a literal
reading of its own definition of a parsimonious reduction, which asks for a
bijection between the `n`-slices, does not accommodate a change of size
parameter.  The statements below are therefore phrased so that the
reparameterisation is explicit rather than absorbed into the word
"parsimonious".

The automaton-level construction — pushing `𝒯` through the encoding — is a
follow-on to these lemmas and is not attempted here.

namespace TreeAutomaton

variable {S : Type u} {Γ : Type v}

/-- Collapse the set of initial states of `A` to one.

The state type gains a single fresh state `none`, which is the sole initial
state of the result.  Its outgoing transitions are exactly the transitions
available at *some* initial state of `A`; the old states keep their own
transitions.  Every transition — old or new — sends only `some`-states to the
children, so `none` occurs at the root and nowhere else.

The cost is one state and one copy of the transitions out of `S₀`, so the
translation is linear in `|A|`.  This discharges the step the CQ reduction
takes for granted when it produces an automaton with a set `S₀` of initial
states and appeals to a model that has only one. -/

    (singleInit A).step (some s) a qs ↔ ∃ ss : List S, qs = ss.map some ∧ A.step s a ss :=

  Iff.rfl

/-- The children clause of `accepts_some_iff`: once the child states are known
to be tagged, running `singleInit A` on the children is running `A` on them.
Stated with the induction hypothesis of `accepts_some_iff` as a hypothesis, so
that it can be applied at the one place it is needed. -/

      simp only [List.map_cons, List.forall₂_cons]
      exact and_congr h₁ h₂

/-- **The behaviour of the old states is unchanged.**  `some : S → Option S`
embeds `A` into `singleInit A` as a subautomaton: no run of `singleInit A`
started at an old state ever reaches the fresh state, because every transition
tags all of its child states.

This is the induction that both directions of `lang_singleInit` reduce to. -/

/-- Acceptance from the fresh initial state is acceptance from some old initial
state.  This is `accepts_some_iff` plus one unfolding at the root. -/

        (forall₂_accepts_map_some (fun u _ _ => accepts_some_iff A u _) ss).2 hchild⟩

/-- **Construction 1 is language-preserving.**  Collapsing the initial states
to one changes neither the automaton's language nor, since it does not touch
trees at all, any tree in it.

This is the statement the CQ reduction needs in order to hand its automaton —
built with a set `S₀` of initial states — to a counting result stated for
single-initial-state automata. -/

/-- **Construction 1 preserves every size slice.**  The `n`-slice is what `#TA`
counts, so this — not merely `lang_singleInit` — is what makes the collapse
usable inside a parsimonious reduction: the identity on trees is a bijection
`L_n(singleInit A) → L_n(A)`. -/

`a(t₁, …, t_k)` becomes the left-combed application
`@(…@(@(a, t₁′), t₂′)…, t_k′)`.

Every node of `t` becomes a leaf and every edge of `t` becomes an internal
`@`-node, which is where the size identity `2n − 1` comes from.

Like `size` and `attachMap`, this is a `mutual` block with a list-level
companion: the recursive occurrence is nested under `List`, so Lean infers
neither structural nor well-founded recursion for a `ts.map toBinary` form. -/

/-- Encoding preserves cardinality, because it is injective.  This is the
combinatorial half of the claim `|L_n(𝒯)| = |L_{2n−1}(𝒯′)|`; the other half is
that the automaton `𝒯′` accepts exactly the encodings of `L(𝒯)`, which is the
follow-on construction. -/

of binary trees of size exactly `2n − 1`.  The reparameterisation `n ↦ 2n − 1`
is visible in `size_of_mem_image_langOfSize` and is *not* absorbed into the
word "parsimonious": the paper's own definition of a parsimonious reduction
asks for a bijection between the slices at the *same* parameter, which this is
not. -/
