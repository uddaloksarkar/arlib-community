# The tree product `T(H)` and Razgon's matching-width lower bound

The structural half of Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching
programs and CNFs of bounded treewidth* ([Raz16],
section `dmwmainproof`, lines 783–1032): the construction `T(H)`, the three
structural lemmas `matchontheway`, `mincase`, `dmwtwstruct`, and the degree
and treewidth bounds that the final theorem `razgonGraph_bounds` needs.

## `T(H)` is the box product

The paper's `T(H)` takes one disjoint copy of `H` per vertex of `T` and, for
each edge `{t₁,t₂}` of `T`, joins the *same-labelled* vertices of the two
copies.  Spelled out on vertices that is `V(T) × V(H)` with
`(t,u) ~ (t',u')` iff (`t = t'` and `u ~_H u'`) or (`t ~_T t'` and `u = u'`) —
verbatim Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.boxProd`, notation `□`.  We reuse it rather
than redefining it, so all of `boxProd_adj`, `boxProd_adj_left`,
`boxProd_adj_right` are available.  There is no `treeProduct` definition: the
graph is literally `T □ H`.

## Connectivity is carried by `ReachableWithin`, not by induced subgraphs

Every hypothesis the paper phrases as "`T` is a tree" is used only through
*connectivity*, and the induction in `dmwtwstruct` needs connectivity of
`T` restricted to a *subset* of its vertices (`T_r ∖ T²`).  Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.induce` would force us to move between vertex types — a
subtype for every subtree at every level of the induction.  Instead
`ReachableWithin T A a b` says "there is a `T`-walk from `a` to `b` all of
whose vertices lie in `A`", and `ConnectedWithin T A` quantifies that over
`A`.  Nothing ever changes vertex type.

Both structural lemmas are therefore proved from strictly weaker hypotheses
than the paper states: `matchontheway` needs only that the two copies are
joined by a walk, and `mincase` needs only `ConnectedWithin`, never acyclicity.

## Everything is relativised to a *region*

The engine of the whole file is `RegionSplit T H p A m`, the paper's
strengthened induction hypothesis:

> for each permutation `SV` of `V(T_r(H))` the required matching can be
> witnessed by a partition of `SV` into a prefix and a suffix of size at
> least `p²` each.

Read literally, that statement is about `T^i(H)` for a *sub*tree `T^i`, with
its own permutation "induced by `SV`".  Constructing that induced permutation
as a term of `VertexOrder (V(T^i) × V(H))` — and matching up its prefixes with
prefixes of `SV` — is pure bookkeeping with no mathematical content.  We avoid
it entirely: `RegionSplit T H p A m` quantifies over orderings of the *ambient*
vertex set and asks for a cut point `i` such that the prefix `prefixSet e i`
meets the region `A ×ˢ univ` in at least `p²` vertices, misses it in at least
`p²` vertices, and carries a cross matching of size `m` *all of whose endpoints
lie in the region*.  A prefix of the induced ordering is exactly
`prefixSet e i ∩ region A`, so this is the same statement, with the induced
ordering never built.

The endpoints-in-region clause is what makes the induction step work: it is
how the matching found inside `T²(H)` is known to be disjoint from the one
found in `(T_r ∖ T²)(H)`.

## What the paper's induction leaves implicit

Four points had to be pinned down.

1. **"Assume w.l.o.g. that `u₁,…,u₄` occur in `SV` in the order they are
   listed."**  This is not a symmetry of the situation — the four subtrees are
   interchangeable but the *cut points* they produce are not.  What the
   argument actually uses is: a subtree whose cut point is a median, one
   subtree whose cut point is at most it, and one whose cut point is at least
   it.  Three subtrees suffice for that (`exists_median`), so
   `regionSplit_step` takes an indexed family `As : Fin 3 → Finset α` and the
   paper's fourth subtree is simply discarded.

2. **The `mincase` case analysis.**  The paper writes "assume w.l.o.g. that
   this class is `V₁`" and then argues that all non-partitioned copies lie in
   `V₁`, which is false as stated — a non-partitioned copy may lie entirely in
   `V₂`.  The repair is in `exists_rich_copy`: a copy lying entirely on the
   *far* side already contributes `|V(H)| ≥ 2p ≥ p` vertices there, so under
   the contradiction hypothesis "no copy has `p` vertices on the far side" no
   such copy exists, and the far-side vertices are confined to the fewer than
   `p` split copies, `p-1` apiece.  The lemma is stated once for a general
   predicate and used for both sides of the partition.

3. **The base case needs a discrete intermediate value theorem.**  "Just
   choose a prefix of size `p²`" presumes one can cut the ordering so that the
   region is met in exactly `p²` vertices.  `exists_eq_of_step_le` supplies it:
   a function `ℕ → ℕ` starting at `0` and growing by at most `1` per step hits
   every value below its supremum.

4. **`mw` only ever appears as a lower bound.**  `dmwtwstruct` concludes
   `MatchingWidthGe`, per the design note in `BranchingPrograms/Basic.lean`.

## The complete binary tree

`T_r` is `binTree r`, on the vertex type `BinTreeNode r = {l : List Bool //
l.length ≤ r}`: a node is the list of turns from the node *up to* the root, so
the parent of `v` is `v.tail` and the children of `v` are `false :: v` and
`true :: v`.  Two properties made this the right choice over heap indexing in
`Fin (2^(r+1) - 1)` or an inductive family indexed by the height:

* the subtree rooted at `w` is `{v | w <:+ v}`, a `Finset` of the *same* type,
  so the induction never transports along an isomorphism;
* the vertex count is `2^(r+1) - 1` on the nose (`card_binTreeNode`), from an
  explicit `Finset (List Bool)` of all lists of length at most `r`.

`binTreeSubtreeSystem` packages the three facts the induction consumes
(`SubtreeSystem`): subtrees are connected, a subtree of height `h` has at
least `2^h` vertices, and a subtree of height `h+2` contains three pairwise
disjoint subtrees of height `h` whose complements-in-the-subtree are still
connected.  `dmwtwstruct` is proved for any `SubtreeSystem` and then
instantiated.

## Treewidth is defined locally

Mathlib at this version has no treewidth.  `TreeDecomposition` here is a local
definition — a decomposition tree, a bag per node, and the three axioms — used
*only* to state the upper bound `treewidth (T_r(H)) ≤ 2·|V(H)| - 1` that
Razgon's `razgonGraph_bounds` needs.  It is deliberately minimal (no width function, no
`sInf` over decompositions, no equivalence with any other characterisation);
if Mathlib ever grows treewidth, this should be deleted rather than developed.

## What is *not* here

The last step of `razgonGraph_bounds` — repackaging `r` as `log n` — is not formalised.
The paper's arithmetic there is loose (it silently replaces `r+1` by
`log n - ⌈log k⌉` and absorbs several constants), and the clean statement is
`binTree_boxProd_matchingWidthGe` itself:
`mw(T_r(H)) ≥ (r + 1 - ⌈log p⌉) * p / 2` with everything explicit.  All bounds
in this file are explicit; no asymptotic notation appears.

/-- **Lemma `matchontheway`** ([Raz16]).

The vertices of `T(H)` are two-coloured by membership in `S`.  Suppose two
copies `H₁`, `H₂` of `H` — sitting at tree vertices `t₁`, `t₂` joined by a walk
inside `A` — are such that for each `u i` in an injective family of `n`
vertices of `H`, the copies of `u i` in `H₁` and in `H₂` get *different*
colours.  Then `T(H)` has a matching of size `n` across the cut, with all
endpoints inside the region over `A`.

The proof is the paper's: walk from `t₁` to `t₂`; somewhere on the way two
consecutive tree vertices carry differently coloured copies of `u i`; take the
edge between those two copies.  Distinct `i` give disjoint edges because both
endpoints of the `i`-th edge are copies of `u i`, and `u` is injective. -/

/-- **A copy with many vertices on one side of the partition.**

This is the step the paper ([Raz16, §5]) argues by
"otherwise the vertices of the copies of `H` associated with the
non-partitioned vertices of `T` all belong to `V₁`" — which is not true as
stated, since a non-partitioned copy may lie entirely in `V₂`.

The correct argument, and the one below: suppose no copy has `p` vertices
satisfying `P`.  A copy outside the exceptional set `B` is homogeneous, and if
it satisfied `P` throughout it would contribute `|V(H)| ≥ p` such vertices — so
it satisfies `¬P` throughout and contributes none.  All `P`-vertices therefore
sit in the fewer than `p` copies of `B`, at most `p-1` each, for a total below
`p²`; but `D`, the set of `P`-vertices over `A`, has at least `p²` elements.

Stating it for a general `P` lets `crossMatching_of_balanced` use it for both
sides of the partition, which is what the paper's "w.l.o.g." elides. -/

/-- **Lemma `mincase`** ([Raz16]).

`A` is a connected set of at least `p` tree vertices, `H` is connected with at
least `2p` vertices, and the cut `S` splits the region over `A` into two parts
of at least `p²` vertices each.  Then `T(H)` has a matching of size `p` across
the cut, with all endpoints in the region.

Two cases, as in the paper.  If at least `p` copies of `H` meet both sides,
each contributes a crossing edge by connectedness of `H`, and the edges lie in
distinct copies so they are disjoint.  Otherwise some copy is homogeneous, and
`exists_rich_copy` produces a second copy with `p` vertices on the other side;

/-- **The paper's strengthened statement, relativised to a region.**

`RegionSplit T H p A m` says: for every ordering of `V(T(H))` there is a cut
point whose prefix meets the region over `A` in at least `p²` vertices, misses
it in at least `p²` vertices, and carries a cross matching of size `m` with all
`2m` endpoints inside the region.

This is `mw(T^i(H)) ≥ m` "witnessed by a partition into a prefix and a suffix
of size at least `p²` each", except that the ordering quantified over is the
ambient one rather than the induced one — see the module docstring. -/

/-- **The induction step of `dmwtwstruct`** ([Raz16, §5]).

`A` contains three pairwise disjoint regions `As 0, As 1, As 2`, each already
known to satisfy `RegionSplit … m`, and removing any one of them from `A`
leaves a connected set.  Then `A` itself satisfies `RegionSplit … (m + p)`.

Take the cut points `i 0, i 1, i 2` supplied by the three sub-regions and let
`k` be a median.  Cutting at `i k` keeps the matching found inside `As k`
verbatim; the sub-region with the smaller cut point puts `p²` of its vertices
before the cut and the one with the larger cut point puts `p²` after it, so
`mincase` applies to `A \ As k` and yields a further `p` edges, disjoint from
the first `m` because the regions are. -/

/-! ## The recursive structure the induction consumes -/

/-- **What `dmwtwstruct` uses about the complete binary tree.**

A `SubtreeSystem` is a family `Sub h A` of "regions of height at least `h`"
such that

* every region is connected (in the ambient graph, in the sense of
  `ConnectedWithin`);
* a region of height `h` has at least `2 ^ h` vertices;
* a region of height `h + 2` contains three pairwise disjoint regions of
  height `h`, and deleting any one of them from it leaves a connected set.

`T_r` supplies this with `Sub h A` = "`A` is the subtree rooted at some node of
depth at most `r - h`" (`binTreeSubtreeSystem`).  Isolating the interface keeps
the induction free of any list manipulation, and records exactly which
properties of the complete binary tree the paper's argument needs — notably
that only *three* of the four grandchild subtrees are used. -/

The paper's decomposition, verbatim: the decomposition tree is `T_r` itself and
the bag at `t` is the copy of `H` at `t` together with the copy at `t`'s parent.
(At the root the "parent" is the root itself, so the root bag is a single copy —
which is why no special case is needed.) -/

evaluated. -/

This is `binTree_boxProd_matchingWidthGe` at `H = P_{2p}`, with its two side
conditions — that a path is preconnected, and that `P_{2p}` has at least `2p`
vertices — discharged once and for all, so that call sites need only `hr`. -/

/-- **The concrete class of Theorem `razgonGraph_bounds`** ([Raz16, §5]),
with `H = P_{2p}` a path on `2p` vertices:

* `T_r(P_{2p})` has `(2^{r+1} - 1) · 2p` vertices;
* its max degree is at most `5`;
* its treewidth is at most `4p - 1`;
* its matching width is at least `(r + 1 - ⌈log p⌉) · p / 2`.

The paper's final step, turning `r` into `log n`, is deliberately not performed
here — see the module docstring.

This is a **derived convenience**: it is exactly the conjunction of
`card_binTree_pathGraph`, `maxDegreeLe_binTree_pathGraph`,
`treewidthLe_binTree_pathGraph` and `matchingWidthGe_binTree_pathGraph`, each of
which is available separately.  Prefer the components at a call site that wants
only some of them; nothing in the library should index into this tuple. -/
