# Discharging the uniformity hypothesis (Razgon, Appendix A)

Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching programs and CNFs of bounded
treewidth*, Appendix A ([Raz16, §A]), turns an arbitrary
{\sc nrobp} into a *uniform* one.  That appendix is what
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/BranchingPrograms/NROBP.lean` points at when it says that
`NROBP.Uniform` "is carried as an explicit hypothesis of every statement that needs it",
and it is what `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §8.4(2) lists as the open end.
This file closes it.

/-! ## Elementary facts about paths

Two facts the paper never states because in prose they are invisible: a path runs upwards
in the node order, and a path is nonempty only if it runs strictly upwards. -/

section PathBasics

/-- **A path runs upwards.**  Immediate from `NROBP.edge_lt`, and the only place the
topological order of `NROBP` is ever used in this development. -/

/-- A path that does not run strictly upwards is empty. -/
theorem path_eq_nil {a b : Fin size} {ls : List (Lit V)} (h : Z.Path a b ls) (hba : b ≤ a) :

/-- The literal list carried by a single edge: empty for an unlabelled edge, a singleton
for a labelled one.  This is the `A(e)` of the paper for a one-edge path. -/
def litList (l : Option (Lit V)) : List (Lit V) :=

    Z.Path a b (litList l) := by
  cases l with
  | none => exact Path.skip h (Path.nil b)
  | some x => exact Path.step h (Path.nil b)

/-- **Decomposition at the last edge.**  A nonempty-in-nodes path ends with an edge.
`NROBP.Path` recurses on its *first* edge, so this is the induction principle every
argument that reasons "backwards from `v`" needs; it is used to prove that a clean program
with no irregular edges has well-defined prefix variable sets. -/

What is actually true is the *first* clause of `NROBP.Uniform`: in a clean program all of
whose relevant edges are regular, any two root-to-`a` paths read the same set of variables.
It needs the strengthened `Uniformize.Clean`, not the paper's `Uniformize.CleanInDegree`.

The *second* clause, `NROBP.Uniform.full_vars`, does **not** follow, and no hypothesis of
this kind can make it follow: a graph with an isolated vertex `v` has a read-once program
for `φ(G)` that never reads `v` at all and has no relevant edges whatsoever.  That is why
the construction below appends a final gadget rather than appealing to this lemma. -/

/-! ## Ranked programs: read-onceness and uniformity from a single local invariant

A program is *ranked* by `R : Fin size → Finset V` when each edge grows `R` by exactly the
variables it reads, and never reads a variable already in `R` at its tail.  That one local
condition delivers both `NROBP.ReadOnce` and `NROBP.Uniform`, and it is the shape the whole
construction below is designed to hit.  Isolating it is what removes the need for the
paper's edge-at-a-time induction: the invariant is checked once, on each of the four
families of edges of the transformed program. -/

/-! ## Arithmetic plumbing: a lexicographic pairing on `ℕ`

Adding nodes to an `NROBP` changes its type, and every new node has to be placed at the
right point in the topological order.  The device used throughout is a two-level
lexicographic pairing of natural numbers: the node `a` of the source program owns the
half-open block `[a·B, (a+1)·B)` of indices, its copy sits at the bottom of that block, and
every gadget node inserted on an edge out of `a` sits inside it.  Since an edge `a → b` has
`a < b`, a gadget node in `a`'s block is automatically above `a`'s copy and below `b`'s. -/

/-! ## The transformation

Given a program `Z` on `m` nodes and a *weight* `W : Fin m → Finset V` satisfying the two
local conditions `uniformize_of_weight` asks for, `uProg Z W` replaces every edge
`a → b` labelled `l` by

```
  a --l--> chain 0 --…--> chain n --unlabelled--> b
```

where the `j`-th link of the chain is a *free binary choice* on the `j`-th variable if that
variable lies in `W b \ (W a ∪ Var(l))`, and an unlabelled edge otherwise.  So the walk
from `a` to `b` reads exactly `W b` beyond `W a`, whichever way it branches.  This is
Razgon's local transformation ([Raz16, §A]) applied to
every edge at once rather than to one irregular edge at a time. -/

/-! ### The transformation, packaged -/

/-- **The core theorem of this file.**  Any program admitting a weight function `W` with
the four listed properties has a *uniform* read-once transform on `uniformizeSize m n`
nodes realising the same `φ(G)`.

The four properties are:

* `hW1`: an edge's tail weight together with the variable it reads is contained in its
  head weight — so the gadget set is what is missing, and the chain restores it;
* `hW2`: a labelled edge does not re-read a variable already in the weight of its tail;
* `hWroot`, `hWleaf`: the weight is empty at the root and everything at the leaf, which is
  exactly what the two clauses of `NROBP.Uniform` need.

This is Razgon's Appendix-A theorem ([Raz16, §A]) with the
one-irregular-edge-at-a-time induction replaced by a single simultaneous transformation;
see the module docstring. -/

/-! ## Bracketing a program between a fresh source and a fresh sink

The weight function the transformation needs must vanish at the root and be everything at
the leaf.  `PVar` does neither in general: a node below the root can carry literals into
it, and the leaf need not see every variable (a graph with an isolated vertex has a
read-once program for `φ(G)` that never reads it).  Both are fixed by *two extra nodes*: a
fresh source `⊥` below everything and a fresh sink `⊤` above everything.  Then
`PVar(⊥) = ∅` for free, and `⊤` is given the weight `univ` by fiat, so that the gadget on
the edge `leaf → ⊤` reads exactly the variables the program never read.

This is the only place two nodes are spent; it is the reason the bound below is stated at
`size + 2`. -/

`uniformize_exists` is the point of the file, and it carries no `Uniform` hypothesis and no
`Clean` hypothesis: cleaning, which the paper performs as a separate preliminary step
([Raz16, §A]), is subsumed, because the transformation gives every
labelled edge a private fresh head. -/

transform realising `φ(G)` on

`uniformizeSize (size+2) n = (size+2) · ((size+2)·(2n+1)·(n+1) + 1)`

nodes, where `n = |V|`.  The paper measures the blow-up in *edges* and gets `2qn` extra
edges for `q` irregular edges; this development measures *nodes* — which is what
`NROBP.le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` counts — and the number above is what the simultaneous transformation
costs: one block of `(size+2)·(2n+1)·(n+1) + 1` nodes per node of the bracketed program,
holding its copy and one chain of `n+1` gadget nodes for each (head, label) pair. -/
