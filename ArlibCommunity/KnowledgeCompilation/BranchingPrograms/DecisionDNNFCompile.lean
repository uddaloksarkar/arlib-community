# Rooted tree decompositions and the running-intersection decomposability engine

Towards Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche, *On compiling CNF into decision-DNNF*, CP 2014,
LNCS 8656, pp. 42–57 ([OD14]).  Their Theorem 1 (§3.4) compiles a CNF of decision-width
`w` over `n` variables into a decision-DNNF of size `O(n·2^w)`, and their Theorem 2 (§3.5)
bounds decision-width by primal treewidth, so a CNF of primal treewidth `t` compiles to a
decision-DNNF of size `O(n·2^t)` — the bound Razgon imports as the bundle
`DecisionDNNF.OztokDarwiche` in `BranchingPrograms/DecisionDNNF.lean`.

Their compiler (Algorithm 1, `c2d`) recurses over a *decision vtree*, a rooted binary tree
of the variables; at a Shannon (leaf) node on variable `X` it emits a **decision node** on
`X` (the only place an `∨`-node is created — [OD14] p.6 — so every `∨`-node is a
decision node), and at an internal node it emits a **decomposable `∧`-node** joining the two
subtrees, whose variable sets are disjoint by construction.  A **cache** keyed by the vtree
node and the residual CNF (`cache(v, S)`) makes the object a DAG and is exactly what turns
the naive `2^{depth}` into the `2^w·n` of Theorem 1.  Decomposability of the internal
`∧`-nodes is the **running-intersection property** of the underlying tree decomposition:
the variables handled strictly below one child are absent from the other child's subtree.

## What this file provides

This file formalizes the *combinatorial core* on which that decomposability rests: a finite
**rooted** tree decomposition `RootedTD`, and the running-intersection consequence that
drives the `∧`-decomposition — a variable occurring strictly below a child `c` of a node `i`
(occurring somewhere in `c`'s subtree but not in `bag c`) does **not** occur anywhere in a
sibling `c'`'s subtree (`RootedTD.sibling_absent`).  This is the "decomposability engine" of
the Oztok–Darwiche compilation: at the `∧`-node combining the children of `i`, the two
children's variable contributions are disjoint, so the node is decomposable in the sense of
`NNF.Decomposable`.

The rooting is a genuine strengthening of `TreeProduct.TreeDecomposition` (on an arbitrary,
possibly infinite, index type with a `SimpleGraph` tree and a walk-form connectivity axiom):
`RootedTD` is finite (`n` nodes indexed by `Fin n`), carries a
`parent : Fin n → Option (Fin n)` forest whose edges *decrease the index* (`parent_lt`, so
the root has the smallest index and every parent chain terminates), and states the
running-intersection property in the *gateway form* the compilation consumes directly
(`running`): a variable occurring both inside and outside a subtree occurs at that subtree's
root.  That gateway form is the standard connectivity axiom specialized to the one separator
the DP needs — the edge `(c, parent c)` is the unique link between `c`'s subtree and the
rest of the tree — so it is exactly "the bags containing `v` form a connected subtree".

## Ancestry as reflexive-transitive closure of `parent`

`RootedTD.Anc c j` — "`c` is an ancestor-or-equal of `j`", equivalently "`j` lies in the
subtree rooted at `c`" — is the reflexive-transitive closure of the parent step
`fun a b => parent a = some b`.  Because each node has at most one parent the step relation
is a partial function, so the ancestors of any node form a *chain* (`Anc.comparable`); this
is what makes distinct children have disjoint subtrees (`Anc.sibling_not_anc`), and the
disjointness together with the gateway axiom gives `sibling_absent`.

Everything here is self-contained and unconditional; it introduces no circuit and imports
`BranchingPrograms/DecisionDNNF` only to sit alongside the bundle it is aimed at.

/-! ## A finite rooted tree decomposition -/

/-- **A finite rooted tree decomposition of `G`.**

`n` nodes indexed by `Fin n`; `bag i` is the bag at node `i`; `parent` roots the forest,
with `parent i = none` at a root.  `parent_lt` orients every parent edge towards a *smaller*
index — so a root has the smallest index in its tree and every parent chain strictly
decreases and therefore terminates, which is what makes ancestry a well-founded
reflexive-transitive closure and gives a post-order (children before parents) by descending
index.

The three tree-decomposition axioms are `mem_bag` (every vertex is in a bag), `edge_bag`
(every edge is inside a bag), and `running` — the running-intersection property in the
*gateway form* the Oztok–Darwiche DP consumes: a vertex `v` occurring in a bag `x` **inside**
the subtree of `c` (unfolded here as `ReflTransGen (parent-step) x c`) and in a bag `y`
**outside** that subtree occurs already in `bag c`.  Since the only tree edge leaving `c`'s
subtree is `(c, parent c)`, this is precisely the standard "the nodes whose bag contains `v`
are connected" (compare `TreeProduct.TreeDecomposition.bags_connected`), specialized to the
separator the compilation uses.

See the module docstring for the relationship to the compiler of [OD14] Theorem 1. -/

  The gateway `running` above is a consequence but is strictly weaker — it says nothing at an
  lca, so a variable could sit in two sibling bags yet not the parent — hence this is a
  separate field.  It is exactly what makes the Oztok–Darwiche `∧`-nodes decomposable: the

  `running` this makes the top-level `∧` over the forest roots decomposable. -/

/-! ## The decomposability engine -/

/-- **A variable occurring strictly below a child is absent from every sibling's subtree.**

If `c` and `c'` are distinct children of a node `i`, and a vertex `v` occurs in a bag `x`
inside `c`'s subtree but *not* in `bag c` itself (so `v` is "forgotten strictly below `c`"),
then `v` occurs in no bag of `c'`'s subtree.

This is the running-intersection consequence that makes the Oztok–Darwiche compilation
produce **decomposable** `∧`-nodes: the `∧`-node at `i` combines contributions from the
children `c`, `c'`, …, and this lemma is exactly the statement that the variable set carried
below `c` (past `bag c`) is disjoint from the variable set carried anywhere below `c'`.  The
proof combines subtree disjointness (`Anc.sibling_not_anc`) with the gateway axiom
`running`: were `v` to occur at `y` in `c'`'s subtree, then — `y` being outside `c`'s
subtree — the gateway forces `v ∈ bag c`, contradicting that it was forgotten below `c`. -/

/-! ## The semantic reduction: `phi` as per-bag coverage

The mathematical foundation of the Oztok–Darwiche DP.  Because every clause `(u ∨ v)` of
`φ(G)` corresponds to an edge, and every edge lies inside some bag (`edge_bag`), the compiler
assigns each clause to a tree node ([OD14] §3.3: "each clause of `Δ` is assigned to the
lowest vtree node that contains the clause variables").  Semantically this means `φ(G)` is
satisfied exactly when *every bag's internal edges are covered* — the statement the tree DP
verifies bag by bag. -/

/-- **`S` is locally valid at node `i`**: it covers every edge with both endpoints in
`bag i`.  These are the bag-assignments the DP enumerates at node `i` ([OD14] §3.3). -/
def LocallyValid (D : RootedTD G) (i : Fin D.n) (S : Finset V) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃u v : V⦄, u ∈ D.bag i → v ∈ D.bag i → G.Adj u v → u ∈ S ∨ v ∈ S

/-- **Every edge lives in a bag**, hence `φ(G)` reduces to per-bag coverage: `α` satisfies
`φ(G)` exactly when, at every tree node `i`, every edge inside `bag i` is covered by `α`.

This is [OD14] §3.3's clause-to-node assignment read semantically, and it is the
invariant the compiler's post-order recursion accumulates. -/
theorem phi_iff_forall_bag [Fintype V] (D : RootedTD G) (α : V → Bool) :

/-! ## The Shannon-node primitive: a decision tree for any function on finitely many variables

The building block of Oztok–Darwiche's compiler ([OD14] §3.3, Algorithm 1): a **decision
node** on a variable `x` is `(x ∧ hi) ∨ (¬x ∧ lo)` where `hi`, `lo` are the Shannon cofactors
`f|x` and `f|¬x`.  Branching on the variables of a list `xs` one at a time yields a decision
tree computing any Boolean function `f` that depends only on `xs`; it is a **decision-DNNF**
— every `∨`-node is by construction a decision node, and every `∧`-node splits a single fresh
literal `x` off from a subtree that no longer mentions `x` (read-once, hence decomposable).

This is the honest, unconditional half of the compilation: `buildDecisionTree` compiles *any*
`f` on `k` variables into a decision-DNNF of `≤ 6·2^k` nodes.  Applied to `φ(G)` over all of
`V` it gives an unconditional decision-DNNF for `φ(G)` (`exists_decisionDNNF_phi`) — the naive
`2^{|V|}` compiler.  The `2^{treewidth}·n` refinement of [OD14] Theorem 1 additionally
shares the cofactor DAGs across the tree decomposition using the running-intersection engine
`RootedTD.sibling_absent`; that sharing is what this file's `RootedTD` layer is aimed at and is
not carried out here. -/

/-! ## The leaf-address variant `dtCoreL`

The Shannon cascade of `dtCore`, but with the leaves pointing at *already-emitted* nodes of
the ambient DAG rather than fresh constants.  This is the gadget the treewidth-shared
compiler of [OD14] §3.4 needs: the inner disjunction `⋁_{τ} D[c,τ]` over the free
variables `bag c \ bag i` is exactly a Shannon cascade whose leaves are the shared child
nodes `D[c,τ]`.

`leaf : (V → Bool) → ℕ` supplies, for each full assignment `τ` to the cascade variables, the
address of the node to land on; `LeafBounded` asks these addresses to be earlier than the
current program, which is what keeps the emitted cascade acyclic (`RawValid`).  Everything is
a controlled copy of the `dtCore` development with `.const (f …)` replaced by "return the
existing address `leaf …`, emit nothing". -/

/-- The leaf-address cascade for `leaf` branching on `xs`, extending `l`.  At `[]` it emits
nothing and returns the caller-supplied address; at `x :: xs` it emits the two literals, the
two conjunctions, and the decision `∨`, exactly as `dtCore`. -/

/-! ## The decomposable `∧`-chain over children

The outer conjunction of the DP node `D[i,σ] = ⋀_c (cascade for child c)` ([OD14] §3.3,
Line 13: `α ← (c2d(vˡ,S₁) ∧ c2d(vʳ,S₂))`).  `andChainCore` left-nests conjunctions over a
list of already-emitted node addresses; an empty list is the constant `⊤`, a singleton is the
address itself (no node), and each further address costs one `∧`-node.  Its decomposability
comes from the pairwise variable-disjointness of the child subcircuits, which
`RootedTD.sibling_absent` supplies. -/

This is the *naive* compiler — the base case `S = ∅` of Oztok–Darwiche's Shannon recursion
([OD14] Algorithm 1) with no caching — so its size is exponential in `|V|` rather than
in the treewidth.  The `2^{treewidth}·|V|` refinement of [OD14] Theorem 1 shares the
Shannon cofactor DAGs across a tree decomposition using the running-intersection engine
`RootedTD.sibling_absent`; assembling that sharing is the remaining work of the `RootedTD`

/-! ## The treewidth-shared compiler: fold building blocks

The shared DAG of [OD14] §3.4: one node `D[i,σ]` per tree node `i` and bag-assignment
`σ ⊆ bag i`, shared across the tree.  Processed in **decreasing index order** — since
`parent_lt` makes every parent's index strictly smaller than its child's, a plain `List.foldl`
over `(finRange D.n).reverse` visits every child before its parent, so the child addresses
`D[c,τ]` a node needs are already recorded.  The pieces below are the per-child cascade
(reusing `dtCoreL`) and its `RawValid`; the `andChainCore` over the children and the fold
itself come next. -/

Process the tree nodes in **decreasing index order** (`(finRange D.n).reverse`); since
`parent_lt` gives every child a strictly larger index, this is a valid post-order — every
child is emitted before its parent, so the shared addresses `D[c,τ]` a node needs are already
in the table. -/

Each Shannon cascade over a bag of width `≤ w+1` adds `≤ 5·2^{w+1}` nodes; a node emits one
`∧`-block per bag-assignment (`≤ 2^{w+1}` of them), each with `≤ n` child cascades; there are
`n` nodes and `≤ n` forest roots.  The bound is loose (`2^{2w}·n²`) versus Oztok–Darwiche's
sharing-optimal `2^w·n`, but explicit and `sorry`-free.  The sharp `2^w·n` bound is achieved
separately by the separator-shared construction `compileNNFSharp`
(`exists_decisionDNNF_of_rootedTD_sharp`, below). -/

/-! ### Step 4a: `IsDecision` — every `∨` gate is a decision node

Every `∨` in `Cfull` comes from a Shannon cascade (`dtCoreL`, i.e. `childCascade`/`rootCascade`),
where `dtCoreL_isDecisionNode` shows it tests a single variable on both branches.  The
`andChainCore` blocks add only `∧`- and `const`-gates (`andChainCore_not_disj`), so the fold
invariant `DisjGood` — "every `∨` at an index `< m` is a decision node" — is threaded through
the whole construction. -/

`belowVars i` is the set of variables carried strictly below `i` — those in a bag of `i`'s
subtree but *not* in `bag i`.  It is the target of the `varsAt(D[i,σ]) ⊆ belowVars i`
containment (still to be assembled) that makes the compiled `∧`-nodes decomposable: the
cascade for child `c` branches on `bag c \ bag i` (⊆ `belowVars i`) and lands on `D[c,τ]`
(⊆ `belowVars c ⊆ belowVars i`), and distinct children contribute disjoint sets. -/

/-! ## Milestone B: the separator-shared construction `compileNNFSharp` (`2^w·n`)

Built alongside the loose construction, which stays untouched.  The child cascades are shared
by the separator restriction `ρ = σ ∩ sep(c)` (`childCascade_sep`), giving one cascade per
`(c, ρ)` rather than per `(i, σ)`.  Within `emitNodeSharp(i)` a *local* cascade table `casc`
is built (phase A) and immediately consumed by the `∧`-chains (phase B); the *global* fold
still threads only `(prog, dp)`, so `compileAux`/root machinery is reused essentially verbatim.
