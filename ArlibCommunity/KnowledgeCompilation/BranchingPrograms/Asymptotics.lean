# Razgon's asymptotic bookkeeping, carried out

The last three statements of Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of
branching programs and CNFs of bounded treewidth*
([Raz16]) are that paper's own asymptotic repackaging of
results proved elsewhere in this directory:

* Theorem `razgonGraph_bounds` ([Raz16, `dmwtw`]) — a family of degree-`5`, treewidth-`≤ k` graphs with
  `mw ≥ (log n · k)/b`;
* Theorem `numVertices_rpow_le_size` ([Raz16, `maintheor`]) — the `n^{k/c}` lower bound on NROBP size;
* Lemma `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size` ([Raz16, `separ`]) — the `n^{log n/c}` bound for `T_r(P_{2r})`.

`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5 says to state explicit bounds and not
asymptotic classes, and §8.4 records that this last step had deliberately not
been taken.  It is taken here, and the convention is kept in the only way it can
be for statements whose whole content *is* the repackaging: **no `O`, `Ω`, `Θ`
or `Filter.Tendsto` appears below.**  Every theorem is a single inequality with a
numeric constant and a numeric threshold on its parameters, and every "for a
sufficiently large `r`" of the paper has become a hypothesis with a number in it.

## `Nat.log` and `Nat.clog`, not `Real.log`

The paper writes `log` for both the floor and the ceiling of the binary
logarithm and switches between them silently — [Raz16, §5] uses `⌈log(·)⌉`, [Raz16, §5]
plain `log`, and [Raz16, §7] mixes the two inside a single displayed formula.  Here:

* `n`, `k`, `p`, `r` are natural numbers and every *matching-width* bound is a
  natural number, so `razgonGraph_bounds` and the matching-width half of `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size` use
  `Nat.log 2` (floor) and `Nat.clog 2` (ceiling).  This is forced anyway:
  `TreeProduct.binTree_boxProd_matchingWidthGe` is stated with `Nat.clog 2 p`,
  because the induction behind it consumes `p ≤ 2 ^ ⌈log p⌉`
  (`Nat.le_pow_clog`).
* The paper's `⌈log k⌉` is read as `Nat.clog 2 k` and its `log n` as
  `Nat.log 2 n`.  Both are the weaker readings of the ambiguous `log`, and since
  `log n` occurs positively and `⌈log k⌉` negatively, both make the statements
  below *stronger* than the alternative readings.
* Only the two NROBP-size statements are real-valued, because
  `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size` produces `2 ^ (t / TCover.f 5)` with `TCover.f 5` an
  honest real.  Even there `Real.logb` is avoided: `n ≤ 2 ^ (⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1)` is
  used as an inequality between *bases*, via `Real.rpow_le_rpow`, so the only
  real logarithm anywhere in the file is the one hidden inside `TCover.f`.

## The paper's "sufficiently large" steps, and what they actually need

Four places in the source hand-wave a threshold.  Each is accounted for.

1. **[Raz16, §5], "in the rest of the proof we assume that `k ≥ 50`."**  *Not
   needed.*  `razgonGraph_bounds` below is proved for every `k ≥ 3` — the range the theorem
   statement itself announces — with the paper's constant `b = 32` unchanged.
   The paper spends `k ≥ 50` on two detours.  The first is the chain
   `(k-y+1)/8 ≥ k/16`; it is avoided by never passing through `k` on the right,
   since the graph is `T_r(P_{2p})` and the available bound is `16·p`-shaped, so
   that the single inequality `5·k ≤ 48·p` — a consequence of `k ≤ 4p+2` and
   `p ≥ 1`, hence valid from `k = 3` on — replaces it (`numerator_bound`).  The
   second is the argument at [Raz16, §5] that `r ≥ 5⌈log k⌉` forces
   `log n ≥ 5⌈log k⌉`, routed through `log(n/20+1)` and `n ≥ 50`; it is replaced
   by `n = (2^{r+1}-1)·2p ≥ 2^r`, whence `Nat.log 2 n ≥ r` outright
   (`le_log_numVertices`), needing only `p ≥ 1`.

2. **[Raz16, §7], "for a sufficiently large `r`, `r ≥ log r + 2`."**  *Not used.*
   The paper needs it to extract `r ≥ log n / 2` from `r = log((n+2r)/4r)`; the
   direct estimate `Nat.log 2 n ≥ r` is stronger and free.  For the record the
   claim is not vacuous: `r ≥ Nat.log 2 r + 2` first holds at `r = 3` and
   `r ≥ Nat.clog 2 r + 2` first holds at `r = 4`, and both fail at `r = 2`.

3. **[Raz16, §7], "for a sufficiently large `r` (and hence sufficiently large `n`),
   `mw(T_r(P_{2r})) ≥ log²n/16`."**  The honest threshold is **`r ≥ 1`**, with
   the paper's constant `16` unchanged: see `log_binTreePathNumVertices_sq_div_le`.  The paper's
   displayed chain at [Raz16, §7] throws away far more than it must by substituting
   `r ≥ log n/2` *before* estimating; feeding
   `Nat.log 2 n ≤ r + Nat.log 2 r + 2` into the matching-width bound instead
   leaves a factor of eight in hand, which is why no real threshold survives.

4. **[Raz16, §5], "for a sufficiently large `r`"**, inside the `log(n/20+1)` detour.
   Deleted along with the detour, by item 1.

The one place a genuine threshold *is* unavoidable is the passage from the
natural-number matching-width bound to the real-valued `n^{k/c}` and
`n^{log n/c}`.  `Nat.log 2 n` undershoots the real `log₂ n` by up to `1`, and
`Nat` division by `32` (resp. `16`) undershoots by up to another `1`; the paper's
"replacing `2^{log n}` by `n`" ([Raz16, §3]) is exact only for the real logarithm.
Absorbing the two roundings costs a factor of two in the constant and forces a
threshold:

* `numVertices_rpow_le_size` below has `c = 64 · TCover.f 5` where the paper's chain gives
  `c = 32 · f(5)`, together with the hypothesis `r ≥ 23`;
* `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size` below has `c = 32 · TCover.f 5` together with the hypothesis `r ≥ 7`.

These are the least thresholds this route supports.  Neither is claimed tight,
and neither weakens anything, since both theorems are statements about an
infinite family indexed by `r`.

## Relation to `Separation.lean`

`Razgon.two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` there is the same theorem in explicit-`r`-and-`p` form, and is
the sharper statement.  `Asymptotics.numVertices_rpow_le_size` below is the paper's shape,
proved *from* the explicit form; the two are kept apart so that the loss incurred
by the repackaging is visible as a lemma (`log_add_one_bound`) rather than hidden
inside a constant.

/-- `2^r ≤ 2^{r+1} - 1`.  This one estimate replaces the whole of the paper's
`log(n/20+1)` detour ([Raz16, §5]). -/

/-- **The rounding loss, once**: if `⌊log₂ n⌋ = L` then `n ≤ 2^{L+1}` as reals,
so `n ^ y ≤ 2 ^ ((L+1)·y)` for every `y ≥ 0`.

This is the substitute for the paper's "replacing `2^{log n}` by `n`"
([Raz16, §3]), which is an identity for the real
logarithm and an inequality — in the unhelpful direction — for the floor.  Using
it as a bound on *bases* rather than on exponents keeps `Real.logb` out of the
file entirely. -/

`x ≥ 1` in prose ([Raz16, §4.1]) but does not state it;
the `n^{k/c}` shape needs it, since `c = 64·f(5)` must be a positive real for the
comparison of exponents to be an equivalence. -/

/-! ## The class `𝐆` of Theorem `razgonGraph_bounds`

The paper ([Raz16, §5]) takes `G = T_r(P_{(k-y+1)/2})` where `0 ≤ y ≤ 3` is chosen so
that `4 ∣ k-y+1`, and then writes `p = (k-y+1)/4` ([Raz16, §5]).  Rather than carry
`y` we name `p` directly: `p = ⌊(k+1)/4⌋` *is* that quotient, and the two
inequalities `4p ≤ k+1` and `k ≤ 4p+2` — i.e. `k-2 ≤ 4p ≤ k+1`, which is exactly
`4p = k-y+1` for some `0 ≤ y ≤ 3` — are all the proof ever uses about it. -/

/-- **The path parameter** `p = ⌊(k+1)/4⌋`

`log n ≥ 5⌈log k⌉`"), obtained directly instead of through `log(n/20+1)`.

`n = (2^{r+1}-1)·2p ≥ 2^{r+1}-1 ≥ 2^r` as soon as `p ≥ 1`.  Nothing else is
needed, which is why the paper's `k ≥ 50` and its "sufficiently large `r`" at

/-! ## The arithmetic of `razgonGraph_bounds`

All of [Raz16, §5] reduces to one inequality
between natural numbers. -/

/-- **The core inequality.**  With `L = ⌊log₂ n⌋`, `c = ⌈log₂ k⌉` and
`D = L - 2c`, one has `L·k ≤ 16·(D·p)` whenever `p ≥ 1`, `k ≤ 4p+2` and
`5c ≤ L`.

The paper arrives at the lower bound `(log n - 2⌈log k⌉)·k/16` and wants
`≥ (log n · k)/32`, which follows from `log n ≥ 5⌈log k⌉` ([Raz16, §5]).  Here `p`,
not `k`, is kept on the right, so that the only fact about `k` required is
`5k ≤ 48p`, and *that* holds from `p ≥ 1` and `k ≤ 4p+2` alone — i.e. from
`k = 3` on.  This is precisely where the paper's `k ≥ 50` ([Raz16, §5]) evaporates. -/

/-- **Theorem `razgonGraph_bounds`** ([Raz16, `dmwtw`]), with the paper's
constant `b = 32` and *without* its `k ≥ 50`:

for every `k ≥ 3` and every `r ≥ 5⌈log₂ k⌉`, the graph `T_r(P_{2p})` with
`p = ⌊(k+1)/4⌋`

* has `n = (2^{r+1} - 1)·2p` vertices,
* has max degree at most `5`,
* has treewidth at most `k`,
* has matching width at least `⌊log₂ n⌋ · k / 32`.

The paper's "infinite class `𝐆`" is the family indexed by `r`; it is infinite
because `n` is strictly increasing in `r` (`numVertices_strictMono`).

Two departures from [Raz16, §5], both argued in
the module header.  First, the standing assumption `k ≥ 50` ([Raz16, §5]) is
unnecessary: the argument runs from `k = 3`, the smallest value the theorem
mentions.  Second, the route from `r ≥ 5⌈log k⌉` to `log n ≥ 5⌈log k⌉`
([Raz16, §5], via `log(n/20+1)` and a "sufficiently large `r`") is replaced
by `n ≥ 2^r`, which needs only `p ≥ 1`.

This is a **derived convenience**: it is the conjunction of `card_vertex`,
`maxDegreeLe_razgonGraph`, `treewidthLe_razgonGraph` and
`matchingWidthGe_razgonGraph`, each of which is available separately.  It is
kept because it is the paper's theorem statement in one place; a call site that
wants only some of the four should use the components. -/

/-! ## Theorem `numVertices_rpow_le_size` in the paper's `n^{k/c}` shape -/

/-- The exponent comparison behind `numVertices_rpow_le_size`, isolated: with `L = ⌊log₂ n⌋`,
`m = ⌊L·k/32⌋` and `L ≥ 23`, `k ≥ 3`, one has `(L+1)·k ≤ 64·m` over `ℝ`.

`64` rather than the paper's `32` is the price of the two floors — `Nat.log`
against the real logarithm, and `Nat` division by `32`.  `L ≥ 23` is the least
threshold at which *this route* works: all the route knows about `m` is
`32m > L·k - 32`, and with that the inequality reduces to `k·(L-1) ≥ 64`, which
at `k = 3` first holds at `L = 23` (`3 · 22 = 66`) and fails at `L = 22`
(`3 · 21 = 63`).  The statement itself is ragged below that — it happens to be
true at `L = 22`, `k = 3` and false at `L = 21`, `k = 3` — so no smaller
uniform threshold is worth chasing. -/

/-- **Theorem `numVertices_rpow_le_size`** ([Raz16, `maintheor`]) in the paper's
own `n^{k/c}` shape:

for every `k ≥ 3` and every `r ≥ max(5⌈log₂ k⌉, 23)`, every uniform read-once
NROBP realising `φ(T_r(P_{2p}))` — a graph on `n` vertices of treewidth at most
`k` — has size at least `n^{k/c}` with

  `c = 64 · TCover.f 5`.

The paper's proof ([Raz16, §3]) composes `le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` (`2^{mw/f(5)}`) with
`razgonGraph_bounds` (`mw ≥ log n · k / b`, `b = 32`) and then replaces `2^{log n}` by `n`,
reaching `c = f(5)·b = 32·f(5)`.  That last replacement is an identity only for
the real logarithm.  Here `log` is `Nat.log 2`, so `n` may exceed `2^{⌊log₂ n⌋}`
by almost a factor of two, and the natural-number division by `32` loses up to
one more unit; **the constant is therefore `64·f(5)`, not the paper's
`32·f(5)`**, and this is bought with the explicit hypothesis `r ≥ 23`.  Both
changes are consequences of insisting on an integer logarithm; with real `log`
throughout, the paper's constant is correct.

`Razgon.two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` in `Separation.lean` is the same theorem without the
repackaging, and is sharper. -/

With `s = ⌊log₂ r⌋` (so that `2s ≤ r` by `two_mul_log_le`) this is the whole of
[Raz16, §7], and the proof of it is the reason
that step needs no "sufficiently large `r`".  Writing `u = r - s` and using
`s ≤ u` — which is exactly `2s ≤ r` — the inequality becomes
`(2s + u + 2)² ≤ 8u(s+u)`, and the slack is large: at `s = u` the two sides are
`9u² + 12u + 4` and `16u²`.  The threshold `r ≥ 3` is what makes `u ≥ 2`; below
it the estimate is genuinely false (`r = 1` gives `9 ≤ 8`), which is why
`log_binTreePathNumVertices_sq_div_le` handles `r ∈ {1,2}` separately.

/-- **Lemma `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size`** ([Raz16, `separ`]), explicitly:

for every `r ≥ 7`, every uniform read-once NROBP realising `φ(T_r(P_{2r}))` has
size at least `n^{⌊log₂ n⌋/c}`, where `n = (2^{r+1}-1)·2r` is the number of
vertices and

  `c = 32 · TCover.f 5`.

This is the paper's `Ω(n^{log n/c})` with the `Ω` removed: the class is the
family indexed by `r`, and the bound holds at every member of it from `r = 7` on.

Two remarks on the paper's proof ([Raz16, `separ`]).  Its first "sufficiently
large `r`" ([Raz16, §7], `r ≥ log r + 2`) is not used here at all — `⌊log₂ n⌋ ≥ r`
is available directly.  Its second ([Raz16, §7]) is not needed either: the
matching-width bound `mw ≥ ⌊log₂ n⌋²/16` holds from `r = 1`
(`log_binTreePathNumVertices_sq_div_le`).  The threshold `r ≥ 7` that *does* appear is a different
thing entirely — it pays for the two integer roundings in the passage to the real
exponent, and it is also why the constant is `32·f(5)` rather than `16·f(5)`.
