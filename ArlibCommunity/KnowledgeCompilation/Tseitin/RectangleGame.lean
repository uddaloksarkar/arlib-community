# The adversarial multi-partition rectangle cover game

Fourth module of `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, formalizing §4 of Florent
de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular
resolution refutations* ([dCM21, §4]).  This is the paper's
new lower-bound tool: an *adversarial* refinement of the Bova–Capelli–Mengel–
Slivovsky rectangle-cover bound (`thm:bovaetal`) in which the partition a
rectangle must respect is chosen by an adversary, not by the cover player.

## The game ([dCM21, §4])

Two players build a set `𝓡` of combinatorial rectangles covering `S ⊆ sat(f)`,
each rectangle *respecting* `f` (containing only models).  In each round the cover
player **Charlotte** picks a still-uncovered `a ∈ S` and a v-tree `T` of the
variables; the adversary **Adam** picks a partition `(X₁, X₂)` of the variables
*induced by `T`* (a subtree and its complement); Charlotte must add one rectangle
for that partition, respecting `f`, that covers `a`.  The game ends when `S` is
covered.  `aR(f, S)` is the minimum number of rounds Charlotte can guarantee,
whatever Adam does.

## Formalization

The game value "Charlotte can finish covering `S` in at most `k` rounds against
every Adam" is the inductive predicate `aRLe f X S k` (`X = var(f)`).  The `done`
constructor closes an already-covered set; the `step` constructor packages one of
Charlotte's rounds — her choice of `a` and `T`, and for **every** subtree `s` Adam
might pick (the `∀ s` is Adam's adversarial move) a rectangle on the induced
partition that respects `f`, covers `a`, and leaves a set Charlotte can finish in
`k` more rounds.  This mirrors `MatchingWidthGe`/`TreewidthLe`: a bound predicate,
here an *upper* bound, avoiding a `sInf` over strategies.

Rectangles and induced partitions reuse `Arlib/Communication/Rectangle.lean`
(`VarPartition`, `Rectangle`, `mem_cross`) and `Circuits/VTree.lean`.

## Theorem 12 is imported

**Theorem 12** (`thm:DNNFlower`): a complete DNNF `D` computing `f`
bounds the game, `aR(f, S) ≤ |D|`.  Its proof assigns each round a *distinct* gate
of `D` via a proof-tree descent.  It is carried as the `structure`
`Imported.DNNFtoRectangleGame`; the closely related, **fully proved** single-balanced-
partition cover bound is `LowerBounds/RectangleLemma.lean`
(`bestCov_le_size_of_respects`), which is the evidence that "circuit size bounds
rectangle complexity" is real here — the adversarial-v-tree refinement is the extra
content the import stands in for.

Charlotte can finish covering `S ⊆ sat(f)` (variables `X = var(f)`) in at most `k`
rounds, whatever partitions Adam chooses.

* budget `0` — nothing is left to cover.
* budget `k + 1` — either nothing is left, or Charlotte plays a round: she names
  an uncovered `a ∈ S` and a v-tree `T` of `X`, and for **every** subtree `s`
  (Adam's adversarial choice of the induced partition) she supplies a rectangle on
  that partition which respects `f` (all members are models), covers `a`, and
  reduces the game to one she can finish in `k` further rounds.

Defined by structural recursion on the round budget `k` (the recursive call is at
a strictly smaller budget) rather than as an inductive, since the recursion occurs
under an `∃`, which the kernel forbids for a nested inductive. -/

/-! ## The adversarial game always terminates: the `|S|` bound

A clean, DNNF-free bound showing the game value is always finite: Charlotte can
cover `S` in at most `|S|` rounds, whatever Adam does, by spending one round per
model with the rectangle "all assignments agreeing with `a` on `X`", which is a
valid rectangle for *every* partition Adam might pick.  This is far weaker than
Theorem 12's `|D|` (which can be exponentially smaller than `|S|`), but it is the
non-adversarial-strength specialization that is provable without proof-tree
machinery — see `Imported.DNNFtoRectangleGame`. -/

/-- **The singleton rectangle at `a`**: the assignments agreeing with `a` on both
sides of the partition — i.e. on all of the partitioned variables.  A valid
rectangle for *any* partition, covering `a`, and (when `f` depends only on the
partitioned variables) respecting `f`. -/

/-! ## Theorem 12: a complete DNNF bounds the game — as an imported result -/

namespace Imported

/-- **`thm:DNNFlower`** ([dCM21]), as an
imported hypothesis: a complete DNNF `D` computing `f` bounds the adversarial game
by its size, `aR(f, S) ≤ |D|` for every `S ⊆ sat(f)`.

The proof ([dCM21, §4]) assigns each round a distinct gate of `D`: Charlotte plays a
proof tree of `D` accepting `a`, reads a v-tree off it, and answers Adam's chosen
subtree `v` with the rectangle `sat(D, v) = A × B`; because the chosen `a` is never
again inside any previously used `sat(D, v)`, a fresh gate is used each round, so at
most `|D|` rounds occur.

**Kept boxed — the precise obstruction (studied against `LowerBounds/RectangleLemma`).**
The descent of `RectangleLemma` (`descend`/`valAt_of_descend`/`descend_eq_of_agree`,
`bestCov_le_size_of_respects`) proves the *fixed-partition* bound: a **structured**
d-SDNNF `C` (one respecting a **single, given** v-tree `T`) yields, for one balanced
cut of `T`, a rectangular cover/partition of `f⁻¹(true)` of size `|C|`, indexed by the
nodes of `C` — with **no proof trees**.  Two things block reusing it for this game,
and both are load-bearing:

1. **The DNNF here is only decomposable + complete, not structured.**  The descent
   needs `C.Respects T` for a *fixed* `T`; a general decomposable DNNF respects no
   single v-tree.  The game escapes this precisely by letting Charlotte pick a
   *different* v-tree each round, read off a **proof tree of `D` accepting `a`** — and
   "read a v-tree off a proof tree of a decomposable-complete circuit, respected by
   that circuit on `a`" is proof-tree machinery the area deliberately does not build
   (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §4 records that proof trees were *not* needed — for the *structured*
   rectangle lemma).
2. **The round bound `≤ |D|` is a gate-charging argument, not a cover count.**  The
   descent covers *all* of `f⁻¹(true)` at once; the game plays adversarial *rounds*
   and must charge each round to a fresh gate `v` = root of Adam's chosen subtree, via
   the fact that the chosen `a` never re-enters a used `sat(D, v)`.  That needs the
   `sat(D, v)` subcircuit-along-proof-trees semantics, again absent.

So this is the deliberate `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 exception (cf.
`Imported.VertexSplitEquiv` in `Splitting.lean`, `Imported.HarveyWood` in
`Branchwidth.lean`): stated, never an `axiom`.

**What is proved in reach** (this file): the game value is monotone in the budget
(`aRLe_mono`) and the adversarial game always terminates in `≤ |S|` rounds
(`aRLe_le_card`) — the DNNF-free, non-adversarial-strength bound.  And the
*fixed-partition* content the descent *does* give is fully proved as
`RectangleLemma.bestCov_le_size_of_respects` / `hasPartitionOfSize_cutPartition`.

The hypotheses are the paper's, modulo completeness: `NNF` carries no smoothness
predicate at this version, so the bundle is stated for a decomposable DNNF and the
completeness assumption the proof uses is recorded here rather than as a field. -/
