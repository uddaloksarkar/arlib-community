# The main theorem (Theorem 1)

The headline of `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`: Florent de Colnet and Stefan
Mengel, *Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular resolution
refutations*, `theorem:main_result` ([dCM21]).

**Theorem 1.**  For an unsatisfiable `T(G,c)` with `G` connected of maximum degree
`≤ Δ`, the smallest regular resolution refutation length `S` satisfies

  `2^{2·tw(G)/(9Δ)} ≤ c₀ · S · |V(G)|`,

i.e. `S ≥ 2^{2·tw/(9Δ)} / (c₀·|V|)`.  Stated multiplicatively to avoid truncated
`ℕ`-division, with an explicit constant and no `Ω`.

## The assembly

`two_pow_le_refutationLen_mul_card` is **proved by composition** of the two halves
this area builds:

1. **Step 1** (`UnsatToSat.dnnfSizeLe_of_regRefutationLen`): a regular refutation of
   length `S` gives a DNNF of size `≤ c₀·S·|V|` computing a *satisfiable* `T(G,c*)`.
2. **Step 2** (`DNNFLowerBound.dnnf_lower`, the proved Lemma 22 arithmetic): every
   DNNF computing `T(G,c*)` has size `≥ 2^{2·tw/(9Δ)}`.

Chaining, `2^{2·tw/(9Δ)} ≤ |D| ≤ c₀·S·|V|`.  The genuinely proved content is this
composition together with `dnnf_lower`'s pigeonhole; the deep structural facts
(the game realization producing `dnnf_lower`'s geometric hypotheses for the
specific DNNF, and the Step-1 BP objects) are consumed from the boxed imports.

A satisfiable `c*` exists whenever `G` is connected — `c* = 0` gives `T(G,0)`,
satisfiable by Proposition 3 (`Basic.tseitin_satisfiable_iff`; zero charge is even
on every component).

## Imports

* `Imported.TseitinDNNFLower` — Lemma 22 realized on a DNNF: it supplies, for each
  DNNF computing `T(G,c*)`, the geometric data (`bw ≥ (2/3)tw`, independent subset,
  splitting) that `dnnf_lower` consumes.  This is the adversarial-game realization,
  boxed (`RectangleGame`/`Splitting`), un-inhabited.
* `Imported.AlekhnovichRegRefutationUpper` — the matching **upper** bound ([dCM21, §1]),
  a regular refutation of length `≤ 2^{c₁·tw}·|V|^{c₂}`, needed only for the
  characterization's "if" direction.  Boxed, un-inhabited.

## Scope

This is Theorem 1, the main lower bound.  The full **characterization** — bounded
regular refutation length `⟺` treewidth `O(log |V|)` — is the comparison of
`two_pow_le_refutationLen_mul_card` with `Imported.AlekhnovichRegRefutationUpper`
across a family of graphs; it is an asymptotic statement over families and is left
as the documented intended reading rather than a single formal corollary.  The
Step-1 sub-lemmas are boxed; see `Search.lean`, `UnsatToSat.lean`.

Lemma 22), imported: every DNNF computing the satisfiable `T(G,c*)` supplies the
geometric data — a cut with `|V'| ≥ bw ≥ (2/3)tw`, a max-degree-`Δ` independent
subset, and a splitting keeping `k ≥ |V''|/3` connected — that
`DNNFLowerBound.dnnf_lower` turns into the size bound `2^{2t/(9Δ)} ≤ |D|`.

/-- **`theorem:main_result`** ([dCM21]),
**proved by composition**, with the explicit constant of `lem:dnnf_lower`.  For an
unsatisfiable `T(G,c)` (`G` connected, maximum degree `≤ Δ`, treewidth `t`) and a
satisfiable `T(G,c*)`, any regular resolution refutation of `T(G,c)` of length `S`
satisfies

  `2^{2·t/(9Δ)} ≤ c₀ · S · |V(G)|`.

Proof: Step 1 (`dnnfSizeLe_of_regRefutationLen`) gives a DNNF of size `≤ c₀·S·|V|`
for `T(G,c*)`; the boxed realization feeds its geometric data to the proved
`dnnf_lower`, giving `2^{2t/(9Δ)} ≤ |D|`; chain. -/
