# Tseitin-formulas: the parity system of a charged graph

Foundation module for `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, which follows Florent
de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular
resolution refutations* ([dCM21]).  This file formalizes
the paper's "Tseitin-Formulas" paragraph ([dCM21, §2]),
its Proposition 3 (satisfiability, [dCM21, `proposition:satisfiability_tseitin_formula`]) and Proposition 4 (model count,
[dCM21, `proposition:number_model_tseitin_formula`]), and the conditioning operation ([dCM21, §2]).

## The object

For a graph `G = (V, E)` and a *charge function* `c : V → 𝔽₂`, the Tseitin-formula
`T(G, c)` has one Boolean variable `x_e` per edge `e ∈ E` and one parity
constraint per vertex,
`χ_v : ∑_{e ∋ v} x_e = c(v)  (mod 2)`,
and `T(G, c) := ⋀_{v ∈ V} χ_v`.

## Design decisions

**Semantic, not syntactic.**  As in `BranchingPrograms.Basic` (`φ(G)`) and
`Forgetting.Basic`, no CNF datatype is built.  `Formula G c` is directly the
predicate on assignments "every vertex parity constraint holds".  The paper uses
`T(G, c)` in two guises — a system of parity constraints and, once it turns to
proof systems ([dCM21, §2]), a CNF encoding — but every statement formalized here
(Propositions 3 and 4, conditioning) is about the *satisfying assignments*, so
the semantic predicate is the right object and the CNF encoding is deferred to
the resolution modules (see `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md`).

**Values in `ZMod 2`, not `Bool`.**  An assignment to the edge variables is a map
`{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet} → ZMod 2`.  The paper writes `x_e ∈ {0, 1}` and the
constraint as a sum mod `2`; taking the values in the field `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2` makes
the parity constraint a genuine linear equation and lets the GF(2) double-counting
of Proposition 3 be `Finset.sum` manipulation rather than `Bool` case analysis.
This is the same choice the source's linear-algebra proofs make implicitly.

**Edge variables indexed by the edge set.**  The variable type is the subtype
`{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet}`, so `|E|` free variables and no phantom ones — which is
what Proposition 4's count `2^{|E| − |V| + K}` is about.

## What is proved here

* **Proposition 3, the easy direction** (`even_charge_of_sat`) is proved in full:
  if `T(G, c)` is satisfiable then every connected component has even total
  charge.  The argument is the GF(2) double count — summing `χ_v` over a
  component, each edge of the component is counted at both endpoints, so the
  edge contributions cancel mod `2`.
* **Proposition 3, the converse** (even charge ⟹ satisfiable) is carried as an
  inhabited bundle `Imported.TseitinSatisfiabilityConverse`, per `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md`
  §1.3: it needs a spanning-forest construction that Mathlib's tree API does
  not support cheaply.  `tseitin_satisfiable_iff` assembles the two directions into
  the paper's biconditional.
* **Proposition 4, the model count**, is carried as an inhabited bundle
  `Imported.TseitinModelCount` (a GF(2)-rank fact), not proved here.

Both bundles are inhabited at the foot of the file so that the conditional
statements are known not to be vacuous.

each edge.  The variable type is the edge set itself, so there are exactly `|E|`
variables ([dCM21, §2]). -/

index set of the sum in the parity constraint `χ_v`
([dCM21, §2], the set `E(v)`). -/

/-- **The Tseitin-formula `T(G, c)`** ([dCM21, §2]) as a

of every vertex.  (Named `Formula` rather than `Tseitin` to avoid a namespace

/-! ## Conditioning on an edge literal

Conditioning `T(G, c)` on a literal `ℓ_e` for `e = s(a, b)` yields another
Tseitin-formula `T(G − e, c')` ([dCM21, §2]).  The
underlying graph is `G` with the edge `e` removed; the charge is unchanged for
`¬x_e` and shifted at the two endpoints for `x_e`.  This file provides the graph
and the charge functions — the object `T(G − e, c')` — with the semantic
conditioning correspondence itself deferred to the `Splitting` module, where the
branch recursion consumes it (see `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md`). -/

([dCM21, §2], `G' = G - e`). -/

/-- **`proposition:satisfiability_tseitin_formula`, the easy direction**
([dCM21, `proposition:satisfiability_tseitin_formula`]).  If `T(G, c)` is
satisfiable, then every connected component `U` of `G` has even total charge,
`∑_{v ∈ U} c(v) = 0 (mod 2)`.

The proof sums the constraint `χ_v` over the vertices of the component.  Each
incident edge is counted once at each of its two endpoints — both of which lie in
the component, since an edge joins vertices of the same component — so every edge
variable appears an even number of times and cancels over `𝔽₂`, leaving
`∑_{v ∈ U} c(v) = 0`. -/

/-! ## Proposition 3, the converse — as an inhabited import

The converse — even charge on every component implies satisfiability — needs a
spanning-forest construction (choose a spanning tree of each component, set the
non-tree edges to `0`, and propagate the tree edges from the leaves inward),
which Mathlib does not support cheaply.  Following `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 it is
carried as a named bundle, threaded into the biconditional as a hypothesis, and
inhabited below so the conditional is not vacuous. -/

namespace Imported

/-- **`proposition:number_model_tseitin_formula`**
([dCM21, `proposition:number_model_tseitin_formula`], from Glinskih–Itsykson), as an
imported hypothesis: a satisfiable Tseitin-formula `T(G, c)` has exactly
`2^{|E| − |V| + K}` models, where `K` is the number of connected components.

The count is stated multiplicatively — `2^{|E| + K} = #models · 2^{|V|}` — to
avoid truncated natural-number subtraction; this is equivalent to
`#models = 2^{|E| − |V| + K}` because `|V| ≤ |E| + K` for every graph.  It is a
GF(2)-rank fact (the solution space of the parity system is an affine subspace of
dimension `|E| − rank`, and `rank = |V| − K`) and is not proved here.  The count
is written with `Nat.card`, so the statement needs no `Decidable` instance for
`Formula`. -/

degenerate but genuine witness (the antecedent `∃ α, Formula` is *true* here, so
the count clause is not vacuously discharged). -/
