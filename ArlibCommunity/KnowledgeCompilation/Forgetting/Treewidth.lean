# Jointrees, primal treewidth, and the effect of BVA (`thm:width`, `thm:bva`)

Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche, *On Compiling DNNFs without Determinism*
(Appendix A, [OD17, §A]).  The paper's last theoretical
contribution: bounded variable addition (BVA) raises the primal treewidth of a
CNF by at most the number of applications (`thm:width`), and can drop it
from unbounded to bounded (`thm:bva`).

## How a CNF is represented, and why

There is **no CNF datatype** in this repository, and this file deliberately does
not add one.  Everything the two theorems say about a CNF is mediated by its
*jointree*, and a jointree sees a CNF only through the **variable sets of its
clauses** ([OD17, §A]: "there is a vertex whose labels contain the variables of `γ`").
Literals, polarities, repeated clauses — none of it is visible to treewidth.  So a
CNF is represented here as its list of clause variable-sets,

  `CNF V := List (Finset V)`,

the lightest encoding on which both `thm:width` and `thm:bva` can even be stated.
A `Finset V` per clause is exactly "the variables of `γ`"; a `List` because a CNF
is a conjunction of clauses with no need to deduplicate (and none of the results
depend on the multiset-vs-set distinction).

## Jointrees as genuine trees, and the relation to `TreewidthLe`

A `Jointree Δ` ([OD17, §A]) is a finite **tree** — connected and acyclic,
`SimpleGraph.IsTree` — with a `cluster : ι → Finset V` at each vertex, such that
(covers) every clause's variable set sits in some cluster, and (running
intersection) for each variable the vertices whose cluster contains it induce a
connected subtree.  `width = |largest cluster| − 1`; here phrased, exactly as the
repository's `TreewidthLe`, as the predicate `JointreeWidthLe Δ w` = "some jointree
has every cluster of size at most `w + 1`".

*Acyclicity is not optional.*  `BranchingPrograms/TreeProduct.lean` defines a local
`TreeDecomposition` over an **arbitrary** `SimpleGraph` (no acyclicity), which is
sound there because it is used only for treewidth *upper* bounds.  For `thm:bva`
we also need a *lower* bound, and the min-degree lower bound below is **false**
without acyclicity: the 4-cycle `C₄` has min degree 2 yet admits a width-1
decomposition over the cyclic graph `C₄` itself (bag `i = {vᵢ, vᵢ₊₁}`).  So a
faithful primal treewidth must range over genuine trees, and `Jointree` bundles
`isTree`.

*Kept separate from the graph `TreewidthLe`.*  A jointree is a decomposition of a
CNF/hypergraph (it covers *clauses*), whereas `TreeProduct.TreeDecomposition` is a
decomposition of a `SimpleGraph` (it covers *edges and vertices*); they are
different objects, as the task notes.  They coincide in value — a jointree of `Δ`
is a tree decomposition of `Δ`'s primal graph and conversely — but formalizing
that bridge would force a dependency of this file on the whole
`BranchingPrograms/` development for no gain to either theorem here.  So the two
are defined independently, and this docstring records that they measure the same
quantity.

## What the paper leaves implicit about BVA, and how it is captured

The BVA transformation itself ([OD17, §5.3]) is defined on clauses via resolution:
it replaces a block of resolvents `C_X ⋈ C_{¬X}` by the two smaller blocks `C_X`,
`C_{¬X}` around a fresh variable.  But the proof of `thm:width` ([OD17, §A]) uses BVA
only through **one** consequence: every clause of the transformed CNF `Sig` has its
variable set contained in *some clause of the original `Δ` together with the added
auxiliary variables*.  (The unchanged clauses map to themselves; a clause
`Y ∨ αᵢ` of `Sig` has variables `{Y} ∪ vars(αᵢ) ⊆ vars(αᵢ ∨ β₁) ∪ {Y}` with
`αᵢ ∨ β₁ ∈ Δ`.)  That, plus freshness of the auxiliaries, is `BVAExpansion` below;
it is the exact abstraction of BVA that the treewidth argument consumes, and it is
what makes both theorems provable without a literal-level resolution engine.

`BVAExpansion Δ Sig aux` is the *composite* of `aux.card` single applications: a
single step adds one fresh variable (`BVAExpansion.step`), and steps compose with
the aux sets unioning (`BVAExpansion.trans`).  So "`Sig` obtained by applying BVA
`k` times" is `BVAExpansion Δ Sig aux` with `aux.card = k`, and `thm:width` reads
`w ↦ w + aux.card`.

## Status of the two theorems

* **`thm:width`** — `jointreeWidthLe_bvaExpansion`, proved in full: adding the `k`
  auxiliaries to every cluster of the best jointree of `Δ` is a jointree of `Sig` of
  width `w + k`.
* **`thm:bva`** — the concrete classes `deltaA n` (`Δⁿₐ`, [OD17, §5.3.1]) and `deltaB n`
  (`Δⁿᵦ`, [OD17, §5.3.1]) are defined explicitly.  Clause (ii), `treewidth(Δⁿᵦ) ≤ 2`
  (`jointreeWidthLe_deltaB_two`), is proved by exhibiting the paper's width-2
  **star** jointree ([OD17, §A]), and `Δⁿᵦ` is shown to be a genuine two-variable
  `BVAExpansion` of `Δⁿₐ` (`bvaExpansion_deltaB`).  Clause (i), the *unbounded*
  treewidth of `Δⁿₐ` (`treewidth(Δⁿₐ) ≥ n`), is **now proved** in the companion
  module `Forgetting/MinDegree.lean` (`jointreeWidthLe_deltaA_ge`); see the note at
  `bvaExpansion_deltaB`.

The construction is the paper's, verbatim: keep the same tree, and put
`cluster'(i) = cluster(i) ∪ aux`.  Covering survives because each `Sig`-clause fits
in some `Δ`-clause plus `aux`; running intersection survives because for a variable
outside `aux` the carrying vertices are unchanged, while a variable of `aux` now
sits in *every* cluster and the whole (connected) tree witnesses its connectedness;
and every cluster grew by at most `|aux|`. -/

/-! ## The concrete classes `Δⁿₐ` and `Δⁿᵦ` of `thm:bva`

The variable type carries the base variables `Xᵢ, Yⱼ, Zₖ` (indexed by a `Fin 3`
tag and a `Fin n`) and the two auxiliary variables `A, B` (a `Bool`).

The two classes are defined explicitly; `Δⁿᵦ` is shown to be a genuine
**two-application** BVA expansion of `Δⁿₐ` (`bvaExpansion_deltaB`), so `thm:width`
bounds `treewidth(Δⁿᵦ) ≤ treewidth(Δⁿₐ) + 2` (`jointreeWidthLe_deltaB`); and the
*absolute* bound `treewidth(Δⁿᵦ) ≤ 2` — clause (ii) of `thm:bva` — is proved
outright (`jointreeWidthLe_deltaB_two`) by building the paper's width-2 star
jointree ([OD17, §A]), for which the star graph is shown to be a `SimpleGraph.IsTree`
from scratch (`starGraph_isTree`), Mathlib having no such instance.

**Clause (i), and where it lives.**  Clause (i) of `thm:bva` — that
`treewidth(Δⁿₐ) ≥ n`, the *unbounded* side — is **proved**, in the companion module
`Forgetting/MinDegree.lean` (`jointreeWidthLe_deltaA_ge`; the proof in fact
establishes `2n ≤ w`).  It is the paper's argument ([OD17, §A]) verbatim: the general
`min-degree ≤ treewidth` bound applied to the primal graph of `Δⁿₐ`, whose every
vertex has degree `2n`.  The two pieces Mathlib lacks — a
finite-tree-has-a-leaf lemma and the confined-vertex (leaf-pruning) form of
`min-degree ≤ treewidth` for jointrees — are built there from scratch: a subtree's
leaf is obtained by the *farthest-vertex* route (no handshake, no induced-subgraph
subtypes), and the min-degree core is a leaf-pruning induction over an active
`Finset` of tree nodes, robust to junk cluster variables.  So `thm:bva` is complete:
clauses (i) and (ii), `thm:width`, that `Δⁿᵦ` is a 2-application BVA expansion of
`Δⁿₐ`, and `treewidth(Δⁿᵦ) ≤ 2`. -/
