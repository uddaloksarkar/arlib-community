# Plugging a DNF into every variable of a DNF

This is the step that turns a *query*-complexity statement about a Boolean
function into a *communication*-complexity statement about a two-party function.
Given `f : {0,1}^n → {0,1}` and a gadget `g : {0,1}^b × {0,1}^b → {0,1}`, the
lifted function is `F := f ∘ g^n`, and the upper-bound half of both main theorems
of Göös–Kiefer–Yuan is the same sentence, appearing twice
([GKY22, §2], "Proof of Theorem 1"; reused for
Theorem 2 at [GKY22, §3], "Proof of Theorem 2"):

> `g` and `¬g` have unambiguous `2b`-DNFs, which can be extracted from the
> deterministic decision tree of `g`.  By plugging these unambiguous `2b`-DNFs
> for `g` and `¬g` into the unambiguous `k`-DNF for `f` (and "multiplying out"),
> one obtains an unambiguous `2bk`-DNF for `F`.

That sentence is two constructions — the DNFs for the gadget, and the plugging
in — and this file is those two constructions, together with the three
quantities `Circuits/DNF.lean` says are the ones that matter: the width, the term
count, and unambiguity.

## Part 1: minterms instead of a decision tree

The paper reads the gadget's DNFs off a decision tree.  We do not have decision
trees, and for this application we do not need them: the *minterm expansion* —
one term per satisfying assignment, that term listing every variable — already
meets the paper's bounds.  Its width is `|W|`, which for the gadget's variable
type `W` (Alice's `b` bits and Bob's `b` bits) is the paper's `2b`; and it has at
most `2^|W|` terms, which is no more than the number of leaves of a decision tree
over `W` anyway.  A decision tree would win only when the gadget is much simpler
than a truth table, and nothing downstream reads the term count of the gadget
except through `numTerms_substDNF_le`, where it enters as a base `c` raised to
the width of the *outer* formula.

Minterms make unambiguity trivial rather than delicate, which is the real reason
to prefer them here: a full assignment's term is satisfied by that assignment and
by nothing else, so the satisfied-term list has length at most one because
`Finset.toList` has no duplicates.  This is the counting form of `Unambiguous`
obtained directly, with no re-disambiguation step of the kind Step 1 of the
copy-and-permute construction needs (`LowerBounds/Lifting.lean`).

One consequence worth stating: the DNFs for `g` and `¬g` are `minterms g` and
`minterms (fun β => !g β)`, so the complementarity hypothesis `hcompl` of Part 2
is not an extra assumption to be discharged — it follows from `eval_minterms`
applied twice.

## Part 2: multiplying out

`substDNF ψ pos neg` replaces each positive literal `(i, true)` of each term of
`ψ` by the DNF `pos i`, each negative literal `(i, false)` by `neg i`, and
distributes.  A term of `ψ` of width `w` therefore contributes the unions
`s₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ s_w`, one term `s_j` chosen from the DNF assigned to its `j`-th
literal — `w` nested choices, and hence `c^w` output terms if each inner DNF has
at most `c` terms.

**The product is taken over a list of literals, not over the `Finset`.**
`termSubst` recurses on `t.toList` and multiplies out with `List.flatMap`.  This
is forced by the counting form of `DNF.Unambiguous`, which bounds the *length* of
the satisfied-term list and so is sensitive to a term being listed twice.  A
`flatMap` keeps the choices at distinct positions, and the counting bound for a
`flatMap` (`length_filter_flatMap_le`, the same argument as in
`LowerBounds/Lifting.lean`, where it is the core of both unambiguity proofs) then
splits the count exactly along the structure of the construction: *at most one
source term of `ψ` contributes, and within it at most one choice-tuple does.*
Encoding a choice as a function `Lit ι → Finset (Lit W)` instead would have made
the second half a statement about `Finset.pi` and its enumeration, which is the
machinery `Lifting.canonChoices` exists to supply and which is not needed here.

**The empty product is `[∅]`, not `[]`.**  A term of `ψ` with no literals is the
constant `true`, so it must contribute exactly one output term, namely the empty
one.  Getting this wrong would break `eval_substDNF` on `ψ = [∅]`.

**No consistency hypothesis on `ψ`.**  `Circuits/DNF.lean` deliberately allows a
term to contain both `(i,true)` and `(i,false)`, and this construction inherits
that.  Such a term contributes outputs of the form `s ∪ u ∪ ⋯` with `s` a term of
`pos i` and `u` a term of `neg i`; complementarity makes `pos i` and `neg i`
never simultaneously satisfied, so those outputs are simply never satisfied.
They are still *listed*, which is why the term count is `ψ.numTerms * c ^ k`
regardless, and they are harmless for unambiguity because an unsatisfied term
contributes nothing to a satisfied-term list.  Where they are *not* harmless is
`eval_substDNF`: without `hcompl` a negative literal would not be read correctly,
which is exactly the one place that hypothesis is used.

**Where each hypothesis goes.**  `eval_substDNF` needs only `hcompl`, since a
literal `(i,false)` of `ψ` is satisfied by the substituted assignment precisely
when `eval (pos i) α` is `false`, and that is `hcompl` read backwards.  The width
and count bounds need nothing semantic at all.  `unambiguous_substDNF` needs all
four of its hypotheses, but they are used in two disjoint places: `hp`/`hn` bound
the contribution of a single source term, and `hψ`/`hcompl` bound the number of
source terms that contribute — `hcompl` only through the fact that a satisfied
output forces its source term to be satisfied by the induced assignment.

All three are about the *length of a filtered list*, which is what
`DNF.Unambiguous` counts, or about the length of a `flatMap`, which is what the
term counts below are.  They are private copies of the corresponding lemmas of
`LowerBounds/Lifting.lean`, which are themselves private there; keeping them
private in both places is preferable to giving `Circuits` a dependency on
`LowerBounds`. -/

/-! ## Part 2: substitution

`substDNF ψ pos neg` is the paper's "plugging in and multiplying out".  The three
definitions below are one construction seen at three granularities: a single
literal, a list of literals, and a whole DNF. -/

section Subst

/- No `DecidableEq ι` is needed anywhere below: the outer variable type is only
ever *read* — through `Finset.toList` of a term and through `Term.Sat`, whose
decidability comes from `Bool` — never used to build a `Finset`.  Only the inner
type `W` is combined, by the unions of the multiplying-out. -/
variable {ι W : Type*} [DecidableEq W]
variable {pos neg : ι → DNF W}

/-- **The DNF a literal is replaced by**: `pos i` for `(i, true)` and `neg i` for
`(i, false)`.  Bundling the two families into one function of a literal is what
lets the recursion below treat all literals alike. -/

omit [DecidableEq W] in
@[simp] theorem litDNF_neg (i : ι) : litDNF pos neg (i, false) = neg i := rfl

/-- **Multiplying out along a list of literals.**  The empty list is the empty
conjunction, which is `true` and therefore contributes the single empty term; a
literal `p` in front contributes one union `s ∪ u` for each term `s` of
`litDNF pos neg p` and each term `u` produced by the rest of the list.

A `List.flatMap` rather than a product over a `Finset` of choice functions: the
counting form of `DNF.Unambiguous` is sensitive to positions, and a `flatMap`
keeps the choices at distinct ones.  See the module docstring. -/

Everything reduces to one observation about a single literal, `sat_litDNF_iff`:
the DNF a literal is replaced by is satisfied exactly when the *induced*
assignment `fun i => DNF.eval (pos i) α` gives that literal the value it asks
for.  This is where — and the only place where — complementarity of `neg` and
`pos` is used. -/

paper's `n^{O(bk)}` count of the conjunctions of the composed DNF.

`1 ≤ c` is needed, and only to make `c ^ ·` monotone: a term of width less than
`k` must still be charged `c ^ k`.  It is no loss — `c = 0` would force the inner
DNFs to be empty. -/

/-! ### Unambiguity

The argument splits exactly along the two `flatMap`s of the construction.  Within
one source term, the choices are nested one per literal, and at each level
unambiguity of the inner DNF says at most one choice is satisfied; across source
terms, unambiguity of `ψ` says at most one is satisfied by the induced
assignment.  Both halves are `length_filter_flatMap_le`. -/

/-- **At most one output of a single multiplying-out is satisfied.**  Induction
on the list of literals: a satisfied `s ∪ u` forces `s` satisfied, so at most one
`s` survives (unambiguity of the literal's DNF), and within that `s` at most one
`u` survives (the induction hypothesis).

Note there is no hypothesis relating `pos` and `neg`, and none forbidding a
variable from occurring twice in the list: a list containing both `(i,true)` and
`(i,false)` simply has *no* satisfied output once `pos i` and `neg i` are
complementary, and even without complementarity the bound above holds. -/

/-- **Unambiguity of the substitution** — the conclusion of the paper's sentence,
"one obtains an unambiguous `2bk`-DNF".

All four hypotheses are used, in two disjoint places: `hp` and `hn` bound the
number of satisfied outputs coming from a *single* term of `ψ`
(`unambiguous_listSubst`), while `hψ` and `hcompl` bound the number of terms of
`ψ` that contribute at all — `hcompl` only through `sat_termSubst_iff`, which
turns a satisfied output into a term of `ψ` satisfied by the induced assignment.

**No consistency hypothesis on the terms of `ψ` is needed.**  A term containing
both `(i,true)` and `(i,false)` contributes outputs containing a term of `pos i`
and a term of `neg i`, and `hcompl` makes those never simultaneously satisfied,
so such outputs never appear in a satisfied-term list. -/

/-! ## The two parts, composed

The gadget's two DNFs come from one construction applied to `g` and to `!g`, so
the complementarity hypothesis of Part 2 is discharged rather than assumed.  This
is the exact statement the lifting application consumes: an unambiguous
`(k · |W|)`-DNF, with at most `ℓ · (2^|W|)^k` terms, computing `f ∘ g^n`. -/
