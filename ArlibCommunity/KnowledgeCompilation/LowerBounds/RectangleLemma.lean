# The rectangle lemma

The bridge between circuit size and communication complexity, and the reason a
lower bound on rectangle covers is a lower bound on structured circuits at all
(`lem: rectangle`, [VS24]):

> if `f` admits a d-SDNNF of size `s` then `Par₁(f) ≤ s`; if `f` admits an SDNNF
> of size `s` then `Cov₁(f) ≤ s`.

`LowerBounds/BalancedCut.lean` did the first half — it produces the balanced
partition, by cutting the v-tree at a node carrying between a third and two
thirds of the variables.  This file does the second: it produces one rectangle
per *node of the circuit*, which is where the bound `s = |C|` comes from.

## The shape of the argument

Fix a circuit `C` respecting a well-formed v-tree `T`, and a node `s` of `T`;
write `X = var(s)` and `Y = var(T) \ X` for the two sides of the cut.

The whole proof rests on one structural fact, `Respects.conjSplit`:

> at every `∧`-node of `C`, either the node's own variables all lie in `X`, or
> one of its two children has no `X`-variables at all.

That is `VTree.vars_cases_of_node` transported along `Respects`: the children of
the `∧`-node land inside the two children of some v-tree node, and `X` — being
itself a v-tree node's variable set — cannot straddle those two by laminarity.
Its consequence is that the `X`-dependence of `C` sits on a *path*, not on a
branching structure: descending from the root, at each `∧`-node there is at most
one direction in which `X`-variables can be found.

`descend X α i` walks that path.  It stops as soon as it reaches a node whose
variables all lie in `X`; at an `∧`-node it goes into the child that may carry
`X`-variables; at an `∨`-node it goes into a child that `α` makes true.  The node
it arrives at is the **`X`-witness** of `α`, and the rectangle indexed by a node
`v` is, informally, "the assignments whose `X`-witness is `v`".

## The three lemmas about the descent

Everything is squeezed out of `descend` by three statements, and it is worth
naming what each is for.

* `valAt_descend` — the witness is itself satisfied.  This is what makes the
  *left* half of the rectangle nonempty.
* `valAt_of_descend` — **the lifting lemma**, and the heart of the matter.  If
  `δ` agrees with `α` on `Y` and satisfies the witness node, then `δ` satisfies
  the whole circuit.  In other words the witness carries *all* of the
  `X`-dependence: everything the descent walked past was `Y`-only, by
  `conjSplit`.  This gives both directions of the covering property.
* `descend_eq_of_agree` — **path stability**, and the only place determinism is
  used.  Under the same hypotheses the descent from `δ` arrives at the *same*
  node.  At an `∧`-node this is free, since the branch taken is a syntactic
  condition; at an `∨`-node it is exactly determinism, which forbids the other
  child from having become true.  This is what upgrades the cover to a
  partition.

A fourth, `descend_congr`, is the usual locality statement: the descent depends
on the assignment only through the variables below the starting node.

## Reachability, and why the descent supplies it for free

`Respects` and `Deterministic` are imposed on the nodes *reachable from the
source* (`Circuits/NNF.lean`), so a consumer must produce a proof of
`C.Reaches C.root i` at every node where it wants to use them.  This file is the
main consumer, and it pays nothing: the descent starts at `C.root` and every one
of its steps is a step to a child, so `NNF.Reaches.trans` with
`Reaches.of_conj_left` and friends carries the reachability of the current node
to the next one.  That is the whole of the bookkeeping — the recursive lemmas
`valAt_of_descend` and `descend_eq_of_agree` take `C.Reaches C.root i` alongside
the node `i` and thread it, and the callers, which start at the root, discharge
it with `Reaches.refl`.  `ConjSplit` is relativized the same way, since it is
`Respects` in the only form the descent uses.

## Why the rectangles are indexed by *all* nodes

One might expect to index only by nodes `v` with `var(v) ⊆ X`, since those are
the ones a descent can stop at.  That undercounts: if `C` mentions no
`X`-variable at all — perfectly possible, `X` is chosen from the v-tree, not
from the circuit — then no node satisfies `var(v) ⊆ X` except constants, and
there may be none of those, yet `f⁻¹(1)` still needs a rectangle.  So the index
type is `Fin C.size`, the bound is `|C|` on the nose, and the left half of the
rectangle at `v` is the *conditional*

  `var(v) ⊆ X → val(v) = true`,

which is vacuously true at a node the descent could never stop at.  That
conditional is `X`-local for the same reason `NNF.valAt_congr` is: when the
hypothesis holds, the value at `v` depends only on `var(v) ⊆ X`.

## The hypothesis `var(C) ⊆ var(T)`

The paper takes a v-tree "over `X`" for `X` the variable set of the circuit
(`def: vtree`, [VS24]), so `var(C) = var(T)`.  Our `Respects`
constrains only `∧`-nodes and therefore does *not* imply `var(C) ⊆ var(T)`: a
circuit that is a single literal `x` respects every v-tree vacuously, including
ones that do not mention `x`.  The containment is genuinely needed — a variable
of `C` outside `var(T)` is in neither block of the partition, so no rectangle
could see it — and it is carried as an explicit hypothesis rather than folded
into `Respects`, so that `Circuits/VTree.lean` stays a transcription of the
paper's definition.

/-! ## The structural consequence of respecting a v-tree -/

/-- **At most one child of an `∧`-node carries `X`-variables**, unless the whole
node lies inside `X`.

Isolated as a predicate because it is the *only* thing the descent below needs
to know about the v-tree: `Respects.conjSplit` establishes it, and nothing
afterwards mentions `VTree` again.  Keeping the interface this narrow is also
what makes the descent lemmas readable, since they would otherwise carry four
v-tree hypotheses each.

It is quantified over the nodes reachable from the source, as `Respects` is —
it is nothing but `Respects` in the form the descent uses, and the descent has
the reachability proof in hand at every node it visits. -/

/-- **Respecting a v-tree gives `ConjSplit` at every node of that v-tree.**

The `∧`-node's children land inside the two children `t_ℓ`, `t_r` of some v-tree
node; `VTree.vars_cases_of_node` says `var(s)` cannot straddle those two, being
itself the variable set of a v-tree node; and the three cases transport along
the containments.

This is the step where structuredness is consumed, and the only one. -/

/-! ## The descent to the `X`-witness -/

/-- **The `X`-witness of `α` below the node `i`.**

Walk down from `i`: stop as soon as the current node's variables all lie in `X`;
at an `∧`-node go into the child that may carry `X`-variables (`ConjSplit` says
the *other* one is `X`-free, and the syntactic test `Disjoint var(gₗ) X` decides
which); at an `∨`-node go into a child that `α` satisfies, preferring the left.
Leaves outside `X` stop where they are.

Recursion is on the node index, legitimate by `child_lt`, as everywhere in this
area.  The function is total — it is defined for assignments that do not satisfy
`i` as well, where it returns junk — because a partial function indexed by a
proof of satisfaction would have to be transported along every rewriting of that
proof; all three specification lemmas below carry `C.valAt α i = true` as a
hypothesis instead.

Note that both branch tests at an `∧`-node are *independent of the assignment*.
That is not an accident but the content of `conjSplit`, and it is what makes
path stability at `∧`-nodes free. -/

/-! ### The lifting lemma

The heart of the matter.  Everything the descent walked past is `Y`-only — at an
`∧`-node because `ConjSplit` says the sibling it did not enter has no
`X`-variables, at an `∨`-node because it entered a true child — so an assignment
that agrees on `Y` and satisfies the witness satisfies the whole node. -/

variable {Z : Finset V} {δ : V → Bool}

/-- A node with no `X`-variables has all its variables in `Y`, hence its value is
unchanged by any assignment agreeing on `Y`.  The routine step in the lifting
lemma; note that it is where the hypothesis `var(i) ⊆ Z` earns its keep — a
variable outside `Z` would be in neither block. -/

    (hmZ : C.varsAt m ⊆ Z) (hd : Disjoint (C.varsAt m) P.X)

    rcases P.mem_or_mem (hmZ hx) with h | h
    · exact absurd h (Finset.disjoint_left.mp hd hx)
    · exact h

/-- **The lifting lemma: the `X`-witness carries all of the `X`-dependence.**

If `δ` agrees with `α` on `Y` and satisfies the witness node `descend X α i`,
then `δ` satisfies `i`.  Both directions of the covering property are this
lemma; the crossing property `Rectangle.mem_cross` is its shadow.

The hypothesis at the witness is stated conditionally, `var(w) ⊆ X → …`, because
the descent may stop at a node whose variables are *not* inside `X` — a literal
of `Y`, or a node the circuit never gives an `X`-variable to — and at such a node
nothing needs to be assumed: agreement on `Y` already fixes its value.

`hri` is the reachability of the current node, carried down the recursion so
that `ConjSplit` can be applied at it; the caller starts at `C.root`, where it
is `Reaches.refl`. -/

/-! ### Path stability, and the only use of determinism -/

/-- **Path stability: swapping the `X`-side of an assignment does not move the
witness.**

Under exactly the hypotheses of the lifting lemma, plus determinism, the descent
from `δ` arrives at the same node as the descent from `α`.

At an `∧`-node this is free: the branch the descent takes is decided by the
*syntactic* test `Disjoint var(gₗ) X`, which does not look at the assignment at
all.  At an `∨`-node it is precisely determinism.  Suppose the descent from `α`
took the right child because `α` failed the left one.  Under `δ` the right child
is still satisfied — that is the lifting lemma — so if the left child had become
satisfied too, the `∨`-node would have two satisfied children, which determinism
forbids.

This is the sole use of determinism in the rectangle lemma, and it is exactly
what turns the cover into a partition — and, being the only place `Deterministic`
is consumed, the only place the reachability argument `hri` is needed for
anything but `ConjSplit`. -/

/-! ## The rectangles

One rectangle per node of the circuit.  The node `v` is read as a *candidate
`X`-witness*: the left half asks that `v` be satisfied (when `v` lies inside
`X`), the right half asks that some assignment agreeing on `Y` be accepted by
`C` with `v` as its actual witness. -/

/-- The left half of the rectangle at `v`: *if* `v` lies inside `X`, then `v` is
satisfied.

The conditional form is what lets the family be indexed by every node rather
than only by those inside `X`; see the module docstring.  It is `X`-local
because the hypothesis does not mention the assignment, and under it
`NNF.valAt_congr` applies. -/
def leftAt (C : NNF V) (X : Finset V) (v : Fin C.size) (α : V → Bool) : Prop :=

/-- **The rectangle at the node `v`.**

Left: `v` is satisfied, conditionally on `v` lying inside `X`.  Right: some
assignment agreeing with this one on `Y` is accepted with `v` as its witness.

The right half is an existential over the `X`-side precisely so that it is
`Y`-local by construction — the same device by which a "best partition" argument
forgets what the other player holds. -/

/-! ### The covering property -/

/-- **The rectangles at the nodes of `C` cover `f⁻¹(1)`.**

The interesting direction is that they cover *nothing more*: if `α` satisfies
both halves of the rectangle at `v`, glue the `X`-side of `α` to the `Y`-side of
the witnessing assignment `γ`.  The result satisfies `v` (by the left half, `v`
being inside `X`) and agrees with `γ` on `Y`, so the lifting lemma pushes
satisfaction back up to the root; and it agrees with `α` on all of `Z`, so `α`
itself satisfies `C`.

Determinism is not used, which is why this half of the paper's statement needs
only SDNNF. -/

/-! ### Disjointness, and the only use of determinism -/

/-- **The glued assignment has the same witness as the one it was glued from.**

The step that makes the rectangles disjoint.  `P.cross a γ` agrees with `γ` on
`Y` and satisfies the witness `v`, so path stability applies verbatim.  Note that
`γ` is *not* required to agree with `a` on `Y` here — the gluing already
guarantees the only agreement path stability asks for. -/

/-- **A deterministic circuit gives a rectangular *partition*.**

Suppose `α` lies in the rectangles at `v` and at `v'`, witnessed by `γ` and
`γ'`.  Gluing the `X`-side of `α` onto each gives two assignments whose witnesses
are still `v` and `v'` — that is path stability, hence determinism — but the two
glued assignments agree on all of `Z`: on `X` both are `α`, and on `Y` both are
`α` too, since `γ` and `γ'` were required to agree with `α` there.  By locality
of the descent they have the same witness, so `v = v'`. -/

/-! ## The rectangle lemma

Assembling the two halves.  `BalancedCut` supplies a v-tree node whose variable
set is between a third and two thirds of the whole, hence a *balanced*
partition; this file supplies, for any v-tree node whatsoever, a cover of
`f⁻¹(1)` by `|C|` rectangles for the partition it cuts out. -/

The fixed-partition form.  It is worth having separately from the

names the partition the bound is about — which is what a downstream argument
that has already chosen its partition will want. -/

side conditions are discussed in the module docstring: `var(C) ⊆ var(T)` says
the v-tree really is a v-tree *for `C`*, and `2 ≤ |var(T)|` is what makes a
balanced partition exist at all (`VTree.exists_balanced_cut`; a one-variable set
has no balanced partition). -/

an `∨`-node from acquiring a second satisfied child when the `X`-side of the

pairwise disjoint. -/

/-! ## A non-vacuity check

Five hypotheses is enough that "the theorem is vacuous" deserves an answer, so
they are discharged here on the smallest circuit that has all the moving parts:
the one-node circuit computing the literal `x₀`, against the two-leaf v-tree
`x₀ / x₁`.  It is genuinely non-trivial that this instance goes through — the
circuit does not mention `x₁` at all, which is exactly the configuration
discussed in the module docstring under "why the rectangles are indexed by all
nodes", and the one that forces the conditional form of `NNF.leftAt`.

This also chips at gap G4 of `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` (nothing had ever instantiated
`Respects`), though only barely: `Respects` and `Deterministic` are vacuous here
for want of internal nodes.  A worked instance of the paper's Figure 1 remains
the real target. -/
