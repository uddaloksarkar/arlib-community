# `cor: add` — dSD-`AC` is not closed under addition

The paper's Corollary `cor: add` ([VS24], proof at [VS24, §5]):
*for every `n` there are positive polynomials `f`, `g` each admitting a
dSD-`AC_m` of size `n`, such that any dSD-`AC_p` equivalent to `f + g` has size
`n^{Ω̃(log n)}`.*

This is `thm: union` read through the relabelling `φ` of `Circuits/Arithmetic`,
and it is the last of the paper's four transformation results.

## The shape of the argument

Both directions are a change of reading, not a change of circuit:

* **Upper bound.**  `thm: union` supplies d-SDNNFs for `f` and `g` respecting a
  common v-tree.  `NNF.toAC` reads `∨` as `+` and `∧` as `×`; the graph, and
  hence the size, is untouched, and `NNF.toAC_eval` says the result computes the
  same function as a `{0,1}`-valued polynomial.  Determinism is what makes that
  true — at a non-deterministic `∨`-node the sum would be `2` — and it is
  available because `thm: union` produces *deterministic* circuits.
* **Lower bound.**  Given an arithmetic circuit for `f + g`, `φ` of it is a
  d-SDNNF, of the same size, computing `f ∨ g`; `thm: union` bounds that.

The one arithmetic fact is that `f + g` vanishes exactly where `f ∨ g` is false,
which holds because `f` and `g` are `{0,1}`-valued: a sum of indicators is zero
iff both are.

## The sixth imported result is not needed

The paper's proof takes a dSD-`AC_p` circuit `C` for `f + g` and converts it to a
dSD-`AC_m` circuit `C_m` by flipping the sign of every negative constant, citing
[dCM21b, Lemma 10] — a result imported nowhere else in the paper — and
then applies `φ` to `C_m`.

That step is avoidable, and the reason is `Circuits/Arithmetic`'s
`supp_iff_sat_toNNF_of_deterministic`.  Monotonicity is invoked at exactly one
place in the whole chain: to know `supp(C) = sat(φ(C))`, whose `+` case asks that
two summands not cancel.  Non-negativity gives that by making cancellation
impossible; **determinism gives it by making at most one summand non-zero**, and
determinism is part of the definition of dSD-`AC_p`.  So `φ` may be applied to
`C` directly.

Two consequences, both recorded in the statements below.

*The import disappears.*  `LowerBounds/Imported.lean` anticipated a sixth bundle
here.  There is none: Part D is conditional on exactly `UnionHard`, the same
bundle as `thm: union`, and on nothing else.

*The theorem gets stronger.*  Since neither monotonicity nor positivity is used,
the lower bound holds for every deterministic structured decomposable AC —
`AC.IsdSD`, with no fragment condition.  `exists_dSDAC_pair_hard_sum` below is stated at
that strength, and `exists_dSDACp_pair_hard_sum` is the paper's dSD-`AC_p` statement read
off it, so that a reader can match the literal corollary.

## What `n^{Ω̃(log n)}` is here

As everywhere in this development, the asymptotic is replaced by the explicit
parameter it comes from: the bound is `partBound`, the same numeric parameter
`thm: union` carries, and the upper bound is the same explicit polynomial in the
imported constants.  See `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5.

`f + g` for `{0,1}`-valued `f, g` has the same zero set as `f ∨ g`.  This is the
only calculation in the file. -/

/-! ## `cor: add`

The paper's `cor: add`, at the strength the proof actually delivers.  See the
module docstring for why no fragment condition appears in clause (2) and why
there is no sixth import. -/

/-- **The lower-bound half of `cor: add`**: every deterministic structured
decomposable arithmetic circuit computing `f + g` has size at least `partBound`.

The proof is `φ` and then `thm: union`.  `φ` preserves the graph, so the size
bound it yields is a bound on the arithmetic circuit itself; it preserves the
v-tree and determinism, so the image is a d-SDNNF; and `supp = sat` together
with `indicator_add_ne_zero_iff` says the image computes `f ∨ g`. -/

/-- **`cor: add`** ([VS24]): *dSD-`AC` is not closed
under addition.*

There are two `{0,1}`-valued polynomials `f`, `g` such that

1. each admits a dSD-`AC_m` — hence a dSD-`AC_p` — of the stated explicit size,
   respecting **any** prescribed well-formed v-tree over the variables, and
2. every deterministic structured decomposable arithmetic circuit computing
   `f + g` has size at least `partBound`.

Clause (1) is stronger than the paper's in the same way `thm: union`'s clause (1)
is: the v-tree is the caller's to choose rather than an existential the proof
happens to produce.  Clause (2) is stronger in that it names no fragment — see
the module docstring — and `exists_dSDACp_pair_hard_sum` specializes it to the paper's
dSD-`AC_p`.

Conditional on `Imported.UnionHard` and nothing else. -/

/-- **`cor: add`, in the paper's own vocabulary.**

Identical to `exists_dSDAC_pair_hard_sum` except that clause (2) is restricted to
dSD-`AC_p`, which is the class [VS24, `cor: add`] names, and the v-tree is taken
from the class membership rather than supplied by the caller.  Reading the two statements
side by side is the point: everything `IsdSDACp` contributes beyond `IsdSD` is
the field `IsPositive`, and the proof below discards it — the `-` in the
`rintro` pattern is where the paper's sixth import would have been consumed.

Nothing here is conditional on anything but `Imported.UnionHard`. -/
