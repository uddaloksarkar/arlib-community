# Claim `perm`: a single permutation that reaches both sides for every variable

Claim `perm` ([VS24, `claim: perm`]) is the technical heart of the lifting
from the fixed-partition to the best-partition model.  The paper does not prove
it: it cites Knop, Theorem 4.2, and remarks that "we need to use our more
relaxed notion of balancedness but an inspection of the proof shows that
everything goes through" ([VS24, §4.5]).  This file therefore
*reconstructs* the argument rather than transcribing one; see `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md`,
gap G2.

The statement.  The variables of `ψ'` are identified with a finite field `F` of
order `n' = |F|`.  Each original variable `xᵢ` has `m` copies `y_{i,1}, …,
y_{i,m}`, which are `m` distinct elements of `F`.  Given a balanced partition
of `F` into two blocks, we must find one affine permutation `σ ∈ 𝒫` such that
for **every** `i` and **every** block, some copy `y_{i,j}` is sent into that
block by `σ`.

## Counting, not probability

The argument is a second-moment argument over `𝒫`, and it is stated here
entirely as a count of members of the `Finset` `AffinePerms.maps F`.  Nothing
is gained by building a probability space on `𝒫`: every step of the proof —
the marginals, the second moment, Chebyshev, the union bound — is a statement
about cardinalities, `AffinePerms.card_filter_maps_eq_one` is already an exact
count for exactly this reason, and the ambient measure would have to be
divided out again at the end anyway.  This also keeps the file free of `ℝ`:
the only place a ring larger than `ℕ` appears is `ℤ`, inside `cheb_core`, where
a square is expanded and truncated subtraction would be wrong.

## Chebyshev, cleared of denominators

The textbook step is `Pr[N = 0] ≤ Var N / (E N)²`.  Multiplying through by
`|𝒫|²` turns it into an inequality between integers with no division anywhere:
writing `t` for the number of bad permutations, `P = |𝒫|`, `A = Σ_σ N(σ)` and
`Q = Σ_σ N(σ)²`, the pointwise bound `[N = 0] · A² ≤ (N·P − A)²` summed over
`𝒫` gives

  `t · A² + P · A² ≤ P² · Q`      (`cheb_core`)

and that is the only form of Chebyshev used.  The pointwise bound is trivial —
both sides agree when `N = 0` and the left side vanishes otherwise — so no
variance identity has to be developed.

## What the moments are

Two counting lemmas supply `A` and `Q`.  Both are exact, and both come from
`AffinePerms`:

* `card_filter_apply_eq`: for fixed `x` and `c` there are exactly `|F| − 1`
  members of `𝒫` with `σ(x) = c`, since `a` may be any nonzero scalar and then
  `b` is determined.  Summing over `c ∈ S` gives the *marginal*
  `card_filter_mem`.
* `card_filter_mem_pair`: for `x ≠ x'` there are exactly `|S|·(|S| − 1)`
  members of `𝒫` sending both into `S`.  This is *pairwise independence*
  (`AffinePerms.card_filter_maps_eq_one`) together with the observation that a
  permutation cannot send `x` and `x'` to the same place, so the pair of images
  ranges over the off-diagonal of `S × S`.

Hence `A = m·|S|·(|F| − 1)` and `Q = A + m(m−1)·|S|(|S| − 1)`.

## The constant on `m`, made explicit

The paper takes `m = c·n` for "some sufficiently large constant `c`"
([VS24, §4.4.1]) and never says what `c` is.  Following `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md`
§5, the hypothesis appears here as the explicit inequality `6 · |ι| < m`, and
that is exactly what the argument needs: each of the `2n` events fails for at
most a `3/m` fraction of `𝒫`, so the union bound costs `6n/m`, which is below
one precisely when `m > 6n`.  So **`c > 6` suffices** — under the paper's own
balancedness, with no exact-split assumption.

Three things are worth recording about the arithmetic, because none of them is
visible in the informal sketch, and two of them are easy to get wrong.

* Balancedness is used only through a lower bound on `|S|` — and not even the
  one it supplies.  The companion inequality `3·|S| ≤ 2·|F|` of
  `VarPartition.balanced_iff_left` is **not** needed; it looks as though it is,
  because bounding `|S| − 1` by `|F| − 1` in the second moment loses exactly
  enough to make the upper half of balancedness necessary.  And the lower
  bound that *is* needed is only `|F| ≤ 4·|S|`, a whole factor `|S|` weaker
  than balancedness.  The main statements are therefore given under `4·|S|`,
  with `exists_maps_hits_of_balanced` specialising to the paper's `3`.  This is
  not gold-plating: the partition the lifting will hand over is a partition of
  `V ∪ Z`, with `Z` the `2t` variables encoding `σ` itself, so its restriction
  to `V` is balanced only up to `|Z|`, and a `3·|S|` hypothesis would not apply
  to it while `4·|S|` does.
* No lower bound on `m` beyond `0 < m`, and no lower bound on `|F|` beyond the
  `2 ≤ |F|` that every field has, is needed for the per-event bound
  `card_badMaps_mul_le`.  All of the `m`-dependence lives in the union bound.
* The `3` in the conclusion `t·m ≤ 3·|𝒫|` is the `3` of the `1/3` of
  balancedness, and the `6` in `6·|ι| < m` is `2 · 3` — one factor `2` for the
  two sides.  Nothing else has been absorbed into either constant.

All three fall out of doing the polynomial arithmetic exactly.  After
cancelling `m·|S|·(|F| − 1)²`, Chebyshev collapses over `ℤ` to
`(|F| − m)·(|F| − |S|) ≤ 3·|S|·(|F| − 1)`, and `|F| ≤ 4·|S|` alone settles it.
`key_ineq` is that inequality written out in the shifted variables `|F| − 1`,
`|S| − 1`, `m − 1`, so that `ℕ` never has to subtract; there the difference of
the two sides is visibly `(m−1)·(|F| − |S|) + (|F| − 1)·(4|S| − |F|)`.

For a fixed original variable, `hitCount S y p` is the number of its copies
that the permutation `p` sends into the target set `S`.  This is the paper's

With `t` the number of bad permutations, `P = |𝒫|`, `A = Σ N` and `Q = Σ N²`,

Dividing by `P²·A²` this is `Pr[N = 0] ≤ Q/A²·P − 1 = Var N/(E N)²`, so it is
Chebyshev with the second moment left un-centred.  The proof is the pointwise
bound `[N(σ) = 0]·A² ≤ (N(σ)·P − A)²` summed over `𝒫`: the right-hand sum
expands to `P²Q − PA²` because `Σ N = A` by definition, and the left-hand side
picks up `A²` from each bad `σ` and nothing elsewhere.

`ℤ` is used because the centred square genuinely needs a signed subtraction;
the statement itself is in `ℕ`. -/

/-! ## The arithmetic

Two purely numerical lemmas, isolated so that the counting above is not
obscured by polynomial manipulation.
-/

/-- The polynomial inequality that balancedness buys, with `|F| = q' + 1` and
`|S| = s' + 1`.

The difference of the two sides is exactly `m'·(q' − s') + q'·(4s' + 3 − q')`,
and both summands are nonnegative: the first because `S ⊆ F`, the second
because the hypothesis is `q' ≤ 4s' + 3`.

That second hypothesis is `|F| ≤ 4·|S|`, and it is *sharp for this argument* —
it is the exact condition under which the second summand does not go negative.
Balancedness gives it with a whole factor `|S|` to spare, which is why the file
states its main results under `4` and not under the `3` of balancedness; see
the module docstring. -/

/-! ## The bound for one variable and one side -/

/-- **Step 4 of the argument: at most a `3/m` fraction of `𝒫` is bad.**

If the target set `S` occupies at least a quarter of the field and the `m`
copies `y` are distinct points of `F`, then the number of `σ ∈ 𝒫` sending *no*
copy into `S` satisfies

  `t · m ≤ 3 · |𝒫|`.

Note the shape: multiplied out rather than divided, so that it is an
inequality in `ℕ` with no rounding.

The hypothesis is `|F| ≤ 4·|S|`, not the `|F| ≤ 3·|S|` of balancedness, and
that is deliberate: `4` is what the second-moment computation actually needs
(see `key_ineq`), balancedness gives it with room, and the extra room is not
academic — a partition of a variable set *larger* than `V`, which is the shape
the lifting hands over, restricts to a partition of `V` that is balanced only
up to the variables outside `V`.  See `exists_maps_hits_of_balanced` for the
form the paper states. -/

/-! ## Claim `perm` -/

/-- **Claim `perm`** ([VS24, `claim: perm`]).

Let each of the `|ι|` original variables have `m` copies, given as points of
`F` by `y i : Fin m → F`, distinct for each `i`.  Let `A` and `B` be two target
sets, each at least a quarter of the field.  If `6·|ι| < m` then there is a
single affine permutation `σ ∈ 𝒫` which, for every variable `i`, sends some
copy of `i` into `A` *and* some copy of `i` into `B`.

The hypotheses on `A` and `B` are markedly weaker than "the two blocks of a
balanced partition": disjointness and exhaustiveness are never used, and the
cardinality bound needed is `|F| ≤ 4·|·|` rather than the `3` of balancedness.
See `exists_maps_hits_of_balanced` for the form the paper states, and
`card_badMaps_mul_le` for why the weakening is worth carrying.

The constant is explicit and it is the point of the statement: the paper's
`m = c·n` with `c` unspecified ([VS24, §4.4.1]) becomes `6·n < m`,
i.e. `c > 6` suffices. -/

/-- **Claim `perm` for a balanced partition**, which is the form the paper
states ([VS24, `claim: perm`]).

The partition is of *all* of `F`, matching the paper's identification of the
variable set `V` with the field.  Balancedness enters only through
`Balanced.card_le_left` and `Balanced.card_le_right`, and even those are used
with a factor to spare — see `card_badMaps_mul_le`.  In particular, as
`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §6 G2 requires, no exact split `|X| = |Y|` is assumed anywhere;
the paper's `|Z| ≤ 3·min(|X|,|Y|)` is enough, and is in fact more than enough.

A caveat for the caller.  The paper writes the claim with `Π`, the partition of
`var(ψ)`, but `σ` permutes `var(ψ^∨)` and the partition that matters is `Γ`, of
`var(ψ') = V ∪ Z`.  A partition of `V ∪ Z` is not a `VarPartition` of `F`, so
this corollary does not apply to it directly: use `exists_maps_hits` with
`A := Γ₀ ∩ V` and `B := Γ₁ ∩ V`, whose cardinality bounds have to be derived
from balancedness of `Γ` together with `|Z| = 2t`.  That derivation is why the
`4·|S|` hypothesis is carried. -/

/-- **Claim `perm` for the copy variables**, in the indexing that
`LowerBounds/Copies.lean` uses.

There the copies of `xᵢ` are the variables `(i, j) : ι × Fin m`, and the paper
identifies them with elements of the field by `y_{i,j} := v_{i·m+j}`
([VS24, §4.4.2]).  Any injection `e` realises that identification;
injectivity of each `e (i, ·)` — all the argument actually needs — is inherited
from it. -/
