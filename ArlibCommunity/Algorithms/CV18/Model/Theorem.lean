# CV18 Theorem 1.1

This is the headline audit surface.  The statement below mentions only
objects defined under `Model/`: the input promise, oracle-program semantics,
success event, algorithm, and exact parameter-only query rate.  Its proof
selects the concrete scheduled implementation whose analysis is developed
under `Analysis/`.

The exact displayed rate retains all protected logarithmic factors.  Removing
them gives the paper's `O*(roundness * n^3 / eps^2)` notation; for a
well-rounded body with universal `roundness`, this is `O*(n^3 / eps^2)`.
The deterministic cooling schedule is an internal construction used by the
proof and is deliberately absent from the public theorem statement.

/-- Cousins--Vempala 2018, Theorem 1.1: there is a membership-oracle volume
algorithm succeeding with probability at least `1-p`, with the exact
polylogarithmic refinement of the paper's `O*` query bound.

The algorithm is selected before the body and its membership oracle are
quantified.  Its rate is a model-level function only of the public parameters;
the proof internally constructs the first terminal cooling schedule. -/
