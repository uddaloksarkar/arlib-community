# History-preserving reset before recording a sample

The finite-walk replacement in CV18 must not first append a score and then
try to replace its source sample.  The correct order is:

1. run the operational next-state kernel;
2. reset only the new-state marginal, preserving the old recorded history;
3. append the observable of the reset state.

This file isolates the measure-theoretic bookkeeping for that order.  The
actual reset construction is deliberately an input: a coupling theorem may
produce it from a TV estimate on the new-state marginal.
