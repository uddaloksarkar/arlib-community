/-! # Transporting approximate independence through joint-law identities

The CV18 chronological proof establishes Lemma 7.17(c) when a phase is
created, then runs probability kernels for the remaining phases.  Those
kernels preserve the two already-created scalar observables.  The useful
interface is therefore equality of their joint pushforward laws, rather than
pointwise equality on the whole trace space.

/-- Approximate independence depends only on the joint pushforward law of its
two observables.  This formulation permits the source and target experiments
to have different sample spaces. -/
