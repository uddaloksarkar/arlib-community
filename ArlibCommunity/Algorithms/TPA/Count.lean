# The Tootsie Pop Algorithm: the law of its counter

The Tootsie Pop Algorithm (Huber; which of his papers this sub-area follows is
not settled anywhere in this library — see `ArlibCommunity/Algorithms/TPA.lean`) estimates
a ratio of measures
`μ(B)/μ(B')` by repeatedly drawing from a *shell* and contracting it until the
draw lands in the *centre*.  Its entire analysis rests on one distributional
fact: **the number of contractions a run needs is Poisson** with parameter
`A = ln(μ(B)/μ(B'))`.  This file proves that fact in the elementary form it
actually takes.

## The reduction to a product of uniforms

TPA's ingredients — a nested family `A(β)` whose measure `μ(A(β))` is continuous
in `β` — exist precisely so that one contraction multiplies the measure by an
independent `Uniform(0,1)` factor: if `X` is drawn from `A(β)` and `β'` is the
least index whose set still contains `X`, then `μ(A(β'))/μ(A(β)) ∼ Uniform(0,1)`.
Establishing that for a particular family is the *user's* obligation.

Granting it, a run stops once the running product `U₁ ⋯ U_m` of independent
uniforms drops to `c = μ(B')/μ(B)`.  Write `N = min {m : U₁ ⋯ U_m ≤ c}` for the
number of contractions the run performs, *including* the last one — the one that
lands in the centre — so that `N ≥ 1` always.  Then

  `P(N − 1 ≥ m) = P(U₁ ⋯ U_m > c)`,

and everything reduces to computing that one number.

Note the offset: it is `N − 1`, not `N`, that is Poisson.  That is exactly the
algorithm's bookkeeping — Algorithm 1 does `k ← k − 1` before the loop and
`k ← k + 1` inside it, so a run contributes `N − 1` to the counter `k`.  Getting
this wrong shifts the estimate by a factor of `e`.  Sanity check at `m = 0`:
`tpaTail 0 c = 1 = P(N − 1 ≥ 0)`, whereas the offset-free reading would claim
`P(N ≥ 1) = 1 − c`, which is false since `N ≥ 1` always.

## What is proved

`tpaTail m c` is the closed form

  `tpaTail m c = 1 - c · ∑_{j < m} (ln(1/c))^j / j!`.

* `tpaTail_succ` — it satisfies the recursion `F_{m+1}(c) = ∫_c^1 F_m(c/u) du`
  obtained by conditioning `P(U₁ ⋯ U_{m+1} > c)` on `U₁`.  This is the only
  analysis in the file, and it is a single application of the fundamental theorem
  of calculus: the integrand has the explicit antiderivative `tpaAntideriv`.
  Note the integrand needs no truncation — for `u ≤ c` we would have `c/u ≥ 1`
  and `F_m` would vanish, which is why the integral runs from `c` rather than `0`.

* `tpaTail_sub` — consecutive tails differ by `c · (ln(1/c))^m / m!`.  Since
  `P(N − 1 = m) = P(N − 1 ≥ m) − P(N − 1 ≥ m+1)` and `c = e^{-A}`, this *is* the
  Poisson mass
  `e^{-A} A^m / m!`.  Given the closed form it is one `Finset.sum_range_succ`:
  the Poisson law falls out as pure algebra.

* `tendsto_tpaTail_atTop` — the tail tends to `0`, i.e. a run terminates almost
  surely, so `N` is a genuine random variable.

The point of routing through `tpaTail` is that the *hard* object — an `m`-fold
integral over `[0,1]^m` — is replaced by an induction each of whose steps is
one-dimensional.  No product measure appears anywhere in this file.

/-! ## The closed form -/

/-- `tpaTail m c` is the probability that a product of `m` independent
`Uniform(0,1)` variables still exceeds `c` — equivalently, that a TPA run whose
centre-to-shell measure ratio is `c` performs **more than** `m` contractions, so
that its counter contribution `N - 1` is at least `m`.  The TPA index is
`A = -Real.log c = ln(1/c)`. -/
