# The two running examples: the hard-core model and the Ising model

`Chains/SpinSystem.lean` introduces the hard-core model of the monograph's §1.2
as a weight function and proves that its partition function is positive — and
there the thread stops.  Nothing connects it to the chain the monograph is about.
This module ties the knot: it computes the hard-core local partition function in
closed form, reads off the transition probabilities of the Glauber dynamics as
the monograph states them (`λ/(1+λ)` and `1/(1+λ)` at a free vertex, a
deterministic eviction at a blocked one), and then discharges the hypotheses of
`glauber_reversible` and `glauber_nonnegDefinite` so that the general theory is
visibly *applied* to a named model rather than merely applicable.

The same is done for the Ising model, and the two are worth reading side by side
because of a contrast that is invisible in the general theory.  The hard-core
weight vanishes on most configurations, so `0 < Z` has to be *earned* — the
all-empty configuration is exhibited by hand — and consequently every statement
about the chain carries a hypothesis on the activity `λ`, and the degenerate
branch of `siteUpdate` (where `Zloc = 0`) is a live possibility at `λ = 0`.  The
Ising weight is an exponential, hence strictly positive, so `0 < Z` holds with
*no hypotheses at all*, the Gibbs measure is fully supported, and every
conditional law is genuinely defined.  Positivity of the weight, not any deeper
feature, is what separates a "hard" constraint model from a "soft" one.

The third thing this module does is calibration, in the sense of §1.1 of the
roadmap: on a graph with **no edges** the hard-core model degenerates completely,
and everything can be computed outright — the weight is a product over sites, the
partition function is `(1+λ)^n`, the Gibbs measure is the product of Bernoulli
`λ/(1+λ)` measures, and the single-site update draws the new spin at `v` from that
Bernoulli law *whatever the rest of the configuration is*.  In the extreme case of
a single site the update is literally the chain of
`Chains/IndependentSampler.lean`, which is proved here for an arbitrary weight.

## Main declarations

### The hard-core model

* `IndepOff`, `FreeAt` — the two local predicates the update depends on: `σ` is
  independent away from `v`, and every neighbour of `v` is unoccupied (which,
  read at `u = v`, also excludes a self-loop at `v`).
* `isIndep_update_false_iff`, `isIndep_update_true_iff` — feasibility of the two
  resamplings at `v` in terms of those predicates.
* **`Zloc_hardCoreWeight`** — the exact trichotomy for the hard-core local
  partition function: `0`, `λ^k`, or `λ^k·(1+λ)`, where `k = occupiedOff v σ` is
  the number of occupied sites *other than* `v`.
* **`siteUpdate_hardCoreWeight`** — hence the explicit single-site update: at a
  free vertex the new spin is `true` with probability `λ/(1+λ)`, and at a blocked
  vertex it is `false` with probability `1`.  `hardCoreSiteChain_apply` is the
  same statement for the chain.
* **`hardCoreGlauber_reversible`**, **`hardCoreGlauber_nonnegDefinite`** — the
  general theory landing on the model, with all hypotheses discharged.

### Calibration: no edges

* `hardCoreWeight_noEdges_prod`, **`Z_hardCoreWeight_noEdges`** (`= (1+λ)^n`) and
  **`hardCoreGibbs_noEdges`** — the Gibbs measure is a product measure.
* **`siteUpdate_hardCoreWeight_noEdges`** — the law of the new spin at `v` is a
  fixed Bernoulli, independent of `σ`; the update touches nothing else.
* **`siteUpdate_eq_gibbs_of_unique`** — for *any* weight on a one-site spin
  system the single-site update is the independent sampler of
  `Chains/IndependentSampler.lean`.

### The Ising model

* `spin`, `isingEnergy`, `isingWeight`; `isingWeight_pos` and
  **`Z_isingWeight_pos`**, which needs no hypotheses.
* `isingField` — the local field `∑_{u ≠ v} (J u v + J v u) · s(σ u)`, and
  **`isingEnergy_update`**, the affine dependence of the energy on the spin at
  `v`.
* `logistic`, and **`siteUpdate_isingWeight_true`**: the probability of setting
  the spin at `v` to `+1` is `logistic (2 β · isingField)`.
* **`isingGlauber_reversible`**, **`isingGlauber_nonnegDefinite`**, and
  `isingGibbs_pos` (full support).

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular no
eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## The local structure of the hard-core model

A single-site update at `v` sees the configuration only through two predicates:
whether `σ` violates the independence constraint *away* from `v` (in which case
both resamplings are infeasible and the local partition function vanishes), and
whether `v` is *free*, i.e. all of its neighbours are unoccupied.  Everything in
this section is the translation of `IsIndep` into those two predicates. -/

section LocalDefs

variable {V : Type*}

/-- **`σ` is independent away from `v`**: no edge with *both* endpoints different
from `v` has both endpoints occupied.

This is the part of the hard-core constraint that a resampling at `v` cannot
repair, so it is exactly the condition for `Zloc` to be nonzero. -/
def IndepOff (adj : V → V → Prop) (v : V) (σ : V → Bool) : Prop :=
  ∀ u u', u ≠ v → u' ≠ v → adj u u' → ¬(σ u ∧ σ u')

/-- **`v` is free in `σ`**: every vertex adjacent to `v` (in either direction) is
distinct from `v` and unoccupied.

Reading the definition at `u = v` says `¬ adj v v`: a self-loop at `v` forbids
occupying `v` just as an occupied neighbour does, and folding the two cases
together keeps the statement of `Zloc_hardCoreWeight` a clean trichotomy for an
arbitrary relation `adj`, symmetric or not, loopless or not. -/

/-! ## The local partition function of the hard-core model

The trichotomy below is the computational heart of the module.  Note that the
`1 + λ` of the informal description is only the *last factor*: the local
partition function also carries the weight `λ^k` of the `k` sites occupied away
from `v`, which is common to both resamplings.  That common factor cancels in the
transition probabilities, which is why the informal description is right about
the chain and wrong about `Zloc`. -/

* if `σ` is independent away from `v` but `v` is blocked — some neighbour of `v`
  is occupied, or `adj` has a self-loop at `v` — only the empty resampling
  survives and `Zloc = λ^k`;
* if in addition `v` is free, both resamplings survive and
  `Zloc = λ^k + λ^{k+1} = λ^k (1 + λ)`.

No hypothesis on `λ` is needed: this is an identity of the definitions. -/

/-! ## Calibration: the hard-core model with no edges

`Chains/` earns its place by checking the general machinery against chains that
can be computed exactly, and the empty graph is the case where the hard-core
model can be computed completely.  Every configuration is independent, so the
constraint disappears, the weight factorises over sites, `Z = (1+λ)^n`, and the
Gibbs distribution is a product of independent Bernoulli `λ/(1+λ)` measures.
Correspondingly the single-site update at `v` resamples the spin at `v` from that
Bernoulli measure *ignoring the current configuration altogether*, which is the
independent-sampler behaviour of `Chains/IndependentSampler.lean` restricted to
one coordinate. -/

/-! ## A one-site spin system is an independent sampler

The extreme degeneration.  On a spin system with a single site there is nothing
to condition on, so the conditional law at `v` is the Gibbs measure itself and
the heat-bath update redraws the whole configuration from `μ` in one step.  That
chain is exactly `independentSampler` of `Chains/IndependentSampler.lean`, whose
Dirichlet form is the variance and whose Poincaré constant is `1`.  The statement
holds for an arbitrary weight — the hard-core model on a one-vertex graph is a
special case. -/

/-! ## The Ising model

Spins are `±1`, encoded as `Bool` with `spin true = 1` and `spin false = -1`, and
the weight of a configuration is `exp(β ∑_{u,v} J(u,v) s(σ u) s(σ v))`.  The
double sum runs over *all* ordered pairs, including `u = v`; the diagonal
contributes the constant `∑_v J(v,v)` because `s(σ v)² = 1`, so it is invisible
to the Gibbs measure, and the ordered sum counts each unordered pair twice, which
is why the local field below carries `J u v + J v u` rather than `J v u`.

The contrast with the hard-core model is the point.  `Real.exp` is strictly
positive, so the weight is positive with no hypotheses whatsoever: `0 < Z`
requires no feasible configuration to be exhibited, the Gibbs measure is fully
supported, `Zloc` never vanishes, and the degenerate branch of `siteUpdate` is
unreachable everywhere rather than merely off the support. -/
