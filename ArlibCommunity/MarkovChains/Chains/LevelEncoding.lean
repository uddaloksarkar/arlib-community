# Spin systems as weighted complexes

`Techniques.Levels` builds the up and down walks on the levels of a weighted
complex over an abstract ground set; `Chains.Glauber` builds the Glauber
dynamics on configurations of a spin system.  The monograph observes (§5.1,
Remark at line ~1740) that these are **the same object**: a spin system is the
weighted complex whose ground set is the set of `(vertex, spin)` pairs and whose
top-level faces are the graphs of configurations, and under that identification
the down-up walk at the top level *is* the Glauber dynamics.

This module supplies the identification.

* `graph σ` — the configuration `σ` as a face `{(v, σ v) : v ∈ V}` of the ground
  set `V × S`, with `graph_injective` and `graph_card`.
* `graphWeight w` — the induced top-level weight, and the three hypotheses
  `Techniques.Levels` requires: nonnegativity, support on faces of cardinality
  `|V|`, and total mass `1`.
* `mu_graphWeight` — **the dictionary**: the derived weight of a face `τ` is the
  total weight of the configurations extending it,
  `mu (graphWeight w) τ = ∑ σ, if τ ⊆ graph σ then w σ else 0`.
* `subset_erase_graph_iff` — a face one level below `graph σ` is exactly a
  configuration constraint "agree with `σ` off `v`", and hence
  **`mu_graphWeight_erase : mu (graphWeight w) ((graph σ).erase (v, σ v)) = Zloc w σ v`**:
  the derived weight one level down is the local partition function.  This is
  the heart of the identification — the abstract `mu` and the spin-system `Zloc`
  are the same number.
* `sum_ite_erase` — the reindexing lemma dual to `Levels.sum_ite_insert`: a sum
  over the subfaces of cardinality `k` of a face of cardinality `k + 1` is a sum
  over the elements deleted.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## The reindexing lemma for the down operator

`Techniques.Levels` states the down operator with the subface condition
`τ'.card = k ∧ τ' ⊆ τ`, which is what makes its row sum easy.  To *compute* with
it one wants the other description — the subfaces of a face of cardinality
`k + 1` are exactly the results of deleting one element — and this lemma
converts between them. -/

that it can be rewritten directly into a kernel definition without ever naming a
filtered index set. -/

/-! ## The down-up walk at the top level is the Glauber dynamics

This is the monograph's Remark at line ~1740, made precise.  The two chains
agree on every row of positive weight — that is, `μ`-almost everywhere.  They
must differ on rows of weight zero, where neither the conditional distribution
nor the up operator is determined and each makes its own arbitrary choice; those
rows are invisible to the Gibbs measure. -/
