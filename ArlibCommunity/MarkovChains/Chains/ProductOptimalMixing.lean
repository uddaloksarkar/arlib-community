# Optimal mixing of the Gibbs sampler of a product measure

`Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean` identifies `EntropyContraction μ P ρ` — the
hypothesis `ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ μ[Ent_P(f)]` — as the one that actually iterates, and
supplies the general bridge `entropyContraction_avg_of_tensorization`: from
approximate tensorization of entropy for a family `Kᵢ` it produces entropy
contraction at rate `1/(C |ι|)` for the uniform average `avg K`.  It also runs
the consequences of that hypothesis all the way to a mixing bound in relative
entropy.  What it deliberately does *not* do is instantiate the bridge, because
the instance lives in `Chains/`.

This module is that instance, and it is the first place in the development where
the monograph's headline claim — **optimal `O(n log n)` mixing of the Gibbs
sampler** — is actually reached.  Two identifications make the instantiation
immediate and both hold *definitionally*:

* `siteEnt w hw hZ v f` is by definition `localEnt (gibbs w hw hZ) (siteChain w hw v) f`
  (`siteEnt_apply`, proved by `rfl` in `Chains/GlauberTensorization.lean`);
* `glauber w hw` is by definition `FinKernel.avg (siteChain w hw)`
  (`glauber_eq_avg_siteChain` below, proved by `rfl` after today's hoist pass).

So `ApproxTensorizationEnt w hw hZ C` *is*, symbol for symbol, the hypothesis of
`entropyContraction_avg_of_tensorization` at `K = siteChain w hw`, and its
conclusion *is* a statement about `glauber w hw`.  No bridging lemma is needed in
either direction.

## What comes out

With `approxTensorizationEnt_prodWeight` (`C = 1`) this gives the Glauber dynamics
of a product measure an entropy contraction rate of exactly `1/n`, hence
`Ent_μ(P_GD^t f) ≤ (1 − 1/n)^t Ent_μ(f)`, hence

  `D_KL(P_GD^t(σ, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`   as soon as   `t ≥ n · ln(ln(1/m)/ε)`,

`m` being any lower bound on `μ`.  For a product weight with `a ≤ φ_v(s)` and
`∑_s φ_v(s) ≤ b` one may take `m = (a/b)^n`, so `ln(1/m) = n ln(b/a)` and the
requirement becomes the fully explicit

  `t ≥ n · ln(n · ln(b/a) / ε)`,

which is `O(n log(n/ε))`.  That is the statement
`glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight_of_bounds`.

## Comparison with the variance route

The library already reaches a mixing bound for exactly this chain and exactly
this measure by the χ²/variance route, in
`ProductMeasure.glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight`:

  `‖P_lazy^t(σ, ·) − μ‖_TV ≤ ε`   as soon as   `t ≥ 2n · ln(1/(2 ε √m))`.

The comparison has to be made carefully, because the two statements differ in
three respects at once.  Taking them one at a time:

**1. The `μ_min` dependence — this is the improvement, and it is real.**
Expanding the logarithms, the variance route needs
`t ≥ 2n·ln(1/(2ε)) + n·ln(1/m)` and the entropy route needs
`t ≥ n·ln(1/ε) + n·ln ln(1/m)`.  For a product measure on `n` sites with spin
marginals bounded away from `0` and `1`, `ln(1/m) = Θ(n)`, so the variance route
asks for `Θ(n²)` steps and the entropy route for `Θ(n log n)`.  This is the whole
of the gain, and by `EntropyDecay.klDiv_dirac` versus `chiSq_dirac` its entire
source is the initial divergence from a point start: `log(1/μ(σ))` against
`1/μ(σ) − 1`.

**2. The rate — no improvement is claimed, and none is proved.**  Both routes run
at the *proved* constant `1/n`: `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight` gives
`γ ≥ 1/n` and `entropyContraction_glauber_prodWeight` gives `ρ ≥ 1/n`.  That the
two agree here is because `1/n` is the exact answer for a product measure on both
sides — `n` steps are needed just to touch every site — and **not** an instance of
any general comparison.  `EntropyDecay`'s docstring is careful to say that `ρ` and
`γ` are different quantities and that nothing in this development compares them;
that caveat stands unchanged.  Nothing here proves `ρ ≥ γ`, or `γ ≥ ρ`, for any
other measure.

**3. The factor `2`, and the distance — these are *not* part of the improvement.**
Two honesty notes, in the direction that costs us:

* The `2n` of `glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight` is a laziness artefact, not a cost
  of the variance method.  The Glauber dynamics is positive semidefinite
  (`glauber_nonnegDefinite`), so `mixesWithin_of_log_le` applies to it directly
  and gives `t ≥ n · ln(1/(2ε√m))` with no laziness at all.  That statement is
  proved below as `glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight_of_psd`, precisely so that the
  comparison above is against the best the variance route actually gives rather
  than against the form in which the library happened to record it.  With the
  factor `2` removed, the variance route needs
  `t ≥ n·ln(1/(2ε)) + (n/2)·ln(1/m)` — still `Θ(n²)`, so the conclusion of
  point 1 is unaffected.
* The conclusions are in **different distances**: `MixesWithin` is a
  total-variation statement, and everything proved here is in relative entropy.
  Nothing *below* converts one into the other — the results in this file are
  exactly what they say, bounds on `D_KL`.  `Techniques/Pinsker.lean` and
  `Chains/OptimalMixingTV.lean` now do the conversion, and it is worth recording
  what it actually costs, because the obvious guess is wrong.  The cost is *not*
  "a constant inside a logarithm".  Pinsker turns `D_KL ≤ 2δ²` into
  `‖·‖_TV ≤ δ`, and it is the **squaring `δ ↦ δ²`** that is paid for: `klDiv`
  decays like `(1 − ρ)^t`, so the total variation decays like `(1 − ρ)^{t/2}` —
  the effective decay rate of the distance one wanted is halved, `ρ ↦ ρ/2`, and
  the coefficient of `ln(1/δ)` doubles from `n` to `2n`.  Pinsker's sharp
  constant `2` is the one part of the exchange that is a *gain*: it enters as
  `−n ln 2`, saving steps rather than costing them.  So the `Θ(n log n)` versus
  `Θ(n²)` verdict of point 1 survives the conversion, but the comparison is not
  uniform in `δ`: at fixed `n` and small enough `δ` the variance route wins.  The
  crossover is exact, and it is
  `OptimalMixingTV.entropySteps_lt_varianceSteps_iff`: with `L = ln(b/a)`, the
  entropy route asks for fewer steps precisely when `ln(n·L/δ) < n·L/2`.

## Main declarations

* **`glauber_eq_avg_siteChain`** — the second definitional identification, `rfl`.
* **`entropyContraction_glauber_of_approxTensorizationEnt`** — the corollary
  `Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean` asks for: `C`-approximate tensorization of
  entropy gives the Glauber dynamics entropy contraction at rate `1/(Cn)`.  This
  is what `modLogSobolev_glauber_of_approxTensorizationEnt` should have concluded
  from the same hypothesis; unlike that conclusion, this one iterates.
* **`entropyContraction_glauber_prodWeight`** — rate `1/n` for a product measure.
* `Ent_iter_glauber_prodWeight_le`, `klDiv_iter_row_glauber_prodWeight_le` —
  geometric decay of the entropy and of the relative entropy.
* **`glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight`** — `D_KL(P_GD^t(σ,·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε` once
  `t ≥ n·ln(ln(1/m)/ε)`.
* `gibbs_prodWeight_ge` and **`glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight_of_bounds`** — the
  same with `m` discharged from bounds on the site weights, giving the explicit
  `t ≥ n · ln(n ln(b/a)/ε)`, i.e. `O(n log(n/ε))`.
* `glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight_of_psd` — the variance route without the
  laziness factor, stated for the sake of an honest comparison.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular no
eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-- **Approximate tensorization of entropy gives entropy contraction for the
Glauber dynamics**, at rate `1/(Cn)`.

This is the corollary `Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean` identifies as the one that
`modLogSobolev_glauber_of_approxTensorizationEnt` should have drawn from the same
hypothesis.  The two conclusions differ in exactly the way that matters:
`ModLogSobolev` bounds the *entropy production* `ℰ(f, log f)` below, which by
`Ent_sub_Ent_act_lt_entropyProduction` is strictly larger than the entropy drop
whenever the chain moves anything, so it does not iterate; `EntropyContraction`
bounds the entropy drop itself, and iterates.

The proof is `entropyContraction_avg_of_tensorization`, with nothing to transport:
`ApproxTensorizationEnt w hw hZ C` unfolds to
`Ent_μ(f) ≤ C · ∑_v localEnt μ (siteChain w hw v) f` by `siteEnt_apply`, and
`FinKernel.avg (siteChain w hw)` is `glauber w hw` by
`glauber_eq_avg_siteChain`.  No reversibility, stationarity or positive
semidefiniteness of the chain is used anywhere in the argument. -/

each step touches one of `n` sites, and the coordinates are independent, so no

a two-sided bound and hence (for a general chain) laziness. -/

/-- **Optimal mixing of the Gibbs sampler of a product measure, in relative
entropy.**

Let `μ` be the Gibbs measure of a strictly positive product weight on `n` sites
and let `m > 0` be a lower bound on `μ`.  Then from *every* starting
configuration

  `D_KL(P_GD^t(σ, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`   as soon as   `ln(ln(1/m)/ε) ≤ t/n`,

that is, after `t ≥ n · ln(ln(1/m)/ε)` steps.

**This is the monograph's headline claim, reached for the first time in this
library.**  Since `ln(1/m) = Θ(n)` for a product measure with spin marginals
bounded away from `0`, the requirement is `t = O(n log(n/ε))` — see
`glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight_of_bounds` for that reading made explicit, with `m`
discharged.

The module docstring compares this against `glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight` in
detail.  In one line: the gain is `n·ln(1/m) ↦ n·ln ln(1/m)`, i.e. `Θ(n²) ↦
Θ(n log n)`; the rate `1/n` is the same on both sides and no comparison of `ρ`
with `γ` is claimed; and the conclusion here is in relative entropy, not total
variation, since this development has no Pinsker inequality. -/

/-! ## Discharging `m`: the bound made explicit

Nothing above says how small `μ` can be, and the whole point of the entropy route
is the *shape* of the dependence on that number, so it is worth exhibiting it.
For a product weight the answer is a one-line product estimate: if every site
weight is at least `a` and every site normaliser at most `b`, then every marginal
is at least `a/b` and hence `μ(σ) ≥ (a/b)^n`, so `ln(1/m) = n ln(b/a)` is linear
in `n` — which is exactly the regime in which `ln` versus `ln ln` is the
difference between `n²` and `n log n`. -/

Suppose every site weight satisfies `a ≤ φ_v(s)` and every site normaliser

  `D_KL(P_GD^t(σ, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`   as soon as   `t ≥ n · ln(n · ln(b/a) / ε)`.

This is `glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight` with `m = (a/b)^n` supplied by
`gibbs_prodWeight_ge`, and it is the sense in which the bound is `O(n log(n/ε))`:
the only appearance of `n` inside the logarithm is linear, so the whole
requirement is `n·ln n + n·ln ln(b/a) + n·ln(1/ε)`.

`t ≥ n·ln(1/(2ε)) + (n/2)·n·ln(b/a)`, which is `Θ(n²)`.  The hypothesis `a < b`
is exactly what makes `ln(b/a) > 0`, i.e. what rules out the degenerate case of a

/-! ## The variance route, without the laziness factor

`ProductMeasure.glauber_mixesWithin_prodWeight` states the χ² bound for the
*lazy* Glauber dynamics, because `mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap` is the general
user-facing form and a general chain with a Poincaré inequality need not converge
at all.  The Glauber dynamics is not a general chain: it is positive semidefinite
(`glauber_nonnegDefinite`), so laziness is unnecessary and the factor two it costs
is not a cost of the variance method.

This is recorded here — in the module that compares the two routes — so that the
comparison is against the best the variance route gives, not against the form in
which the library happened to record it.  Removing the factor does not change the
conclusion of that comparison: the `n·ln(1/m)` term survives. -/

of `n`; the extra factor comes from `mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap` halving the gap, and
is unnecessary here because `glauber_nonnegDefinite` already supplies the lower
spectral bound that laziness would manufacture.  So the absolute spectral bound is
`1 − 1/n` rather than `1 − 1/(2n)`, and `mixesWithin_of_log_le` applies directly.

Expanded, the requirement is `t ≥ n·ln(1/(2ε)) + (n/2)·ln(1/m)`, which for a
product measure is `Θ(n²)`.  Compare `glauber_klDiv_le_prodWeight`:
`t ≥ n·ln(1/ε) + n·ln ln(1/m)`, which is `Θ(n log n)`.  The two conclusions are in
different distances (see the module docstring), so this is a comparison of
*hypotheses on `t`*, not a statement that one theorem implies the other. -/
