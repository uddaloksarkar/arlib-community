# The two-site spin system: the spectral independence constant, computed exactly

The whole spectral-independence development — `Techniques.SpectralIndependence`,
`Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence`, `Techniques.SpectralIndependenceConverse`
— was instantiated only at *product* measures
(`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence`), where the covariance form is block
diagonal, the constant is the degenerate `η = 1`, and the local walk's gap is
`1`.  Nothing exhibited a genuinely correlated measure with a computed constant,
so nothing tested whether those definitions have the sharp value on a system
where the sharp value is known.  Per `docs/dev/MarkovChains-ROADMAP.md` §1.1 that is the job of a
`Chains/` module, and this is it.

The system is the smallest one that can be correlated at all: two sites
(`V = Bool`), two spins (`S = Bool`), and an arbitrary distribution on the four
configurations.  Everything is computed in closed form, and the exact spectral
independence constant turns out to be

    **η = 1 + |ρ|,   ρ = (μ₀₀μ₁₁ − μ₀₁μ₁₀) / √((μ₀₀+μ₀₁)(μ₁₀+μ₁₁)(μ₀₀+μ₁₀)(μ₀₁+μ₁₁))**

— one plus the modulus of the Pearson correlation of the two spin indicators,
whose numerator is the determinant of the `2 × 2` table and whose denominator is
the geometric mean of the four line sums.  Since `|ρ| ≤ 1` (Cauchy–Schwarz for
`Cov`, itself the discriminant argument of `Techniques.Bilinear`, with no
eigenvalue), the constant lies in `[1, 2] = [1, |V|]` and **both endpoints are
attained**: `η = 1` exactly in the product case, and `η = 2` at perfect
correlation.  So the two general bounds bracketing it,
`spectralIndependence_of_pairwiseIndep` (`η = 1`) and
`spectralIndependence_card` (`η = |V|`), are each sharp, and neither is sharp
anywhere else.

## What the calibration found

*One claim in `Techniques.SpectralIndependence` is wrong.*  The docstring of
`spectralIndependence_card` says that "for `μ` uniform on the two constant
configurations the ratio is `|V|/2`".  It is `|V|`.  At `|V| = 2` the claim
predicts `η = 1`, and `twoSiteConst_not_spectralIndependence_one` proves that
`SpectralIndependence μ 1` is *false* for that measure, while
`twoSiteConst_eta_eq_card` proves the exact constant is `2 = |V|`.  The bound
`spectralIndependence_card` is therefore attained, not merely valid; the
surrounding text ("that is the right order of magnitude") stands.

*The local walk exists at two sites, and is not degenerate.*  `pinLocalWalk`
requires `|Λ| + 1 < |V|`, so at `|V| = 2` only the empty pinning qualifies — but
it does qualify (`twoSite_card_succ_lt`), and the resulting Poincaré constant
`1 − |ρ|` runs over the whole of `[0, 1]` as the correlation varies.  At perfect
correlation it is `0`, which is right: there `Q_∅` is reducible.

## Main declarations

* `twoSiteCfg`, `twoSiteEquiv`, `twoSite_sum_config` — the four configurations
  and how to sum over them.
* `twoSite_marg_left`, `twoSite_marg_right`, `twoSite_joint` — `marg` and
  `joint` as the line sums and the entries of the `2 × 2` table.
* `twoSiteVar`, `twoSiteCov`, with `twoSite_var_left`, `twoSite_var_right` and
  **`twoSite_cov_eq_det`** — the covariance is the determinant `μ₀₀μ₁₁ − μ₀₁μ₁₀`.
* **`twoSite_quadForm_Cov`** — the `4 × 4` covariance form in closed form,
  `V₀b₀² + 2Cb₀b₁ + V₁b₁²`, obtained from `quadForm_Cov` (the form *is* the
  variance of the linear statistic) rather than by expanding the array.
* `twoSite_sum_marg_sq` and `twoSiteTest` — the diagonal form split into the
  part the covariance form sees and the part it cannot, and the extremal vectors
  where the second part vanishes.
* **`twoSite_cov_sq_le`** — Cauchy–Schwarz for the two entries, from
  `PsdOrder.bilinOf_single` and `SpectralIndependence.bilinOf_Cov_sq_le`.
* **`twoSiteCorr`**, **`twoSiteEta`** — `ρ` and `η = 1 + |ρ|`, with
  `twoSite_corr_eq` in the four probabilities, **`twoSite_corr_gibbs`** in the
  four *unnormalised* weights (the partition function cancels), and
  `twoSite_abs_corr_le_one`.
* **`twoSite_spectralIndependence`** (`η` works),
  **`twoSite_eta_le_of_spectralIndependence`** (`η` is least, away from a
  deterministic site) and **`twoSite_spectralIndependence_iff`** — the constant
  is computed, not merely bounded.  `twoSiteConst_zero_degenerate` shows the
  non-degeneracy hypothesis of the lower bound cannot be dropped.
* **`twoSite_eta_eq_one_iff_pairwiseIndep`** and `twoSite_eta_eq_one_iff_det` —
  the first sanity check: `η = 1` **iff** the measure is a product, calibrating
  `Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence`.
* `twoSiteConst`, **`twoSiteConst_eta`**, `twoSiteConst_eta_eq_card`,
  `twoSiteConst_not_spectralIndependence_one` — the second sanity check: the
  measure on the two constant configurations has `ρ = 1`, `η = 2 = |V|`, and
  refutes `Cov ⪯ 1·diag (marg)`.
* `twoSite_eta_mem_Icc`, `twoSite_spectralIndependence_card_check` — the
  constant lies in `[1, |V|]`, as it must.
* **`twoSite_dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`** — `ℰ_{Q_∅}(f) = ½∑_{s,t} μ(s,t)(f(0,s) −
  f(1,t))²`, computed from the definition of `pinLocalWalk` and
  `dirichlet_self_eq_pair` alone, together with `twoSite_Var_pinDist`.
* **`twoSite_pinLocalWalk_audit`** — the same Poincaré constant `1 − |ρ|` proved
  twice: once through
  `spectralIndependence_iff_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_empty`, once from the
  closed forms with no `Cov` and no `quadForm` anywhere in the proof.
  `twoSite_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_iff` shows `1 − |ρ|` is exact.

*Not done here.*  This module is not imported by `Arlib/MarkovChains.lean`,
because it was written under a rule forbidding edits to existing files; adding
the import is a one-line change that should be made.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`, and no
eigenvalue, spectrum or Hermitian matrix appears anywhere.

`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence` proves `η = 1` for a product measure, via
`spectralIndependence_of_pairwiseIndep`.  Here that is not merely reproved but
*characterised*: for two sites the exact constant is `1` **iff** the measure is
pairwise independent, iff the `2 × 2` table has vanishing determinant.  Since
`twoSite_spectralIndependence_iff` says `1 + |ρ|` is least, this says the
product case is the only one where the degenerate constant is correct. -/

`dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`, not `Cov`, and not spectral independence.  In
probabilistic terms `ℰ_{Q_∅}(f) = ½·E_μ[(X − Y)²]` for `X = f(false, σ_0)` and

The proposition is proved twice, once along each route — the general

`ℰ_{Q_∅}` and `Var_{π_{∅,1}}` from the four table entries on the right.  That
both terms typecheck against the *same* statement is the content: the two
constants are not comparable, they are the same real expression, and there is no
slack in either route. -/
