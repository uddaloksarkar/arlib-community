# The speedy walk on a convex body

Cousins-Vempala (`../gaussian-cooling-vempala/vol3_journal.tex:829`) analyse not the ball walk
itself but the **speedy walk**: the subsequence of *proper* steps of the ball walk, i.e.
"from `x`, resample uniformly from `x + delta*B` until the sample lands in `K`".
Equivalently, the one-step distribution from `x` is the uniform measure on
`B(x, delta) ∩ K` rather than the uniform measure on `B(x, delta)` with the rejected mass
returned to `x`.

The point of the change is the **stationary measure**.  The ball walk is reversible for the
*uniform* measure on `K`; the speedy walk is reversible for the measure with density
proportional to the local conductance `ell`.  That reweighting is what removes the
`hell : ∀ x ∈ K, theta ≤ ell K delta x` hypothesis of
`Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_ballWalk_ge`, whose only proved witness `theta = 2⁻ⁿ`
(`ofReal_le_ell_unitBall`) certifies an exponential step count.

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.speedyWalk K delta` — the speedy-walk kernel.  On a measurable `K` it
  is `(vol(B(x,delta) ∩ K))⁻¹ • volume.restrict (B(x,delta) ∩ K)` plus an atom at `x`
  carrying mass `1` exactly when `B(x,delta) ∩ K` is null (so that the kernel is Markov
  everywhere, including at points from which the walk can never move).
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ellMeasure K delta` — the unnormalised **`ell`-weighted measure**
  `(volume.restrict K).withDensity (ell K delta)`, i.e. `ell(x) dx` on `K`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ellProb K delta` — its normalisation to a probability measure.

## Main results

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.isMarkovKernel_speedyWalk` — the speedy walk is a Markov kernel.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ell_mul_speedyWalk` — the crux identity
  `ell(x) * P_x(T) = vol(B(x,delta))⁻¹ * vol(T ∩ K ∩ B(x,delta))`, unconditionally.  The
  `ell(x)` of the weight cancels the `ell(x)` in the denominator of the kernel, leaving the
  *symmetric* ball kernel; this is the whole content of the next item.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.isReversible_speedyWalk`,
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.isReversible_speedyWalk_prob`,
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.invariant_speedyWalk` — **detailed balance for the `ell`-weighted
  measure**, and hence its invariance.  This is the hypothesis `Cheeger.lean` and
  `L2Mixing.lean` consume.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.image_homothety_subset_of_convex`,
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.volume_inter_ball_le_of_convex` — the **multiplicative overlap
  estimate** for a convex body: the homothety of ratio `1 - ‖u-v‖/delta` centred at the
  midpoint of `u` and `v` maps `B(u,delta) ∩ K` into `B(u,delta) ∩ K ∩ B(v,delta)`, whence
  `vol(B(u,delta) ∩ K) ≤ vol(B(u,delta) ∩ K ∩ B(v,delta)) + (n‖u-v‖/delta)·vol(B(u,delta) ∩ K)`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.one_le_speedyWalk_add_speedyWalk_compl` — **the one-step overlap bound
  with no local-conductance hypothesis at all**:
  `1 ≤ P_u(T) + P_v(Tᶜ) + n‖u-v‖/delta` for `u, v ∈ K`.  Contrast
  `ell_le_ballWalk_add_ballWalk_compl`, whose left-hand side is `ell(u)`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.lt_dist_of_speedyWalk_lt` — separation `delta/(2n)` from an absolute
  `1/4` threshold, where `lt_dist_of_ballWalk_lt` needs `theta/4`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ellMeasure_univ_ne_zero`,
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.exists_smallSet_of_absolutelyContinuous` — the non-degeneracy the
  mixing theorem needs, for a target measure that is *not* uniform.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_speedyWalk_ge` — the conductance bound, with **no `hell`**:
  `Φ ≥ min(1/16, kappa*delta/(128*n))` given an isoperimetric inequality for `ellProb K delta`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.mixesWithin_lazy_speedyWalk` and its unit-ball instance — the mixing
  consequence, in `conductanceMixingTime M (min (1/32) (kappa*delta/(256 n))) eps` steps.

## What the reweighting buys, precisely

`conductance_ballWalk_ge` needs `ell(u) ≥ theta` at every `u ∈ K` because its overlap bound
reads `ell(u) ≤ P_u(T) + P_v(Tᶜ) + n‖u-v‖/(2 delta)`: a body with a sharp corner has points
of tiny `ell`, and there the *uniform* ball walk really does move rarely.  For the speedy
walk the one-step distribution is normalised by `vol(B(u,delta) ∩ K) = ell(u)·vol(delta Bₙ)`,
so the same geometry gives `1 ≤ P_u(T) + P_v(Tᶜ) + n‖u-v‖/delta` — a **constant** on the
left.  So `theta` does not become `3/4`: it **disappears from the statement**, and the
certified conductance `min(1/16, kappa*delta/(128 n))` is polynomial in `n` whenever `kappa`
and `delta` are.

Two inputs make this work and both are recorded honestly:

1. **Convexity of `K`** (`hconv : Convex ℝ K`) is now used, where `conductance_ballWalk_ge`
   used none.  It is what turns the additive midpoint estimate
   `volume_ball_le_volume_inter_ball_add` (a loss of `n t/(2 delta)` *of the whole ball*)
   into the multiplicative `volume_inter_ball_le_of_convex` (a loss of `n t/delta` *of
   `B(u,delta) ∩ K`*).  Without convexity the speedy walk gains nothing: the additive
   estimate leaves `ell(u)` on the left exactly as before.  This is the elementary stand-in
   for Lemma 3.5 of [KLS95] that `vol3_journal.tex:592` invokes; it costs the same one
   factor of `√n` already recorded as caveat 1 of `BallWalkConductance.lean`.
2. **The target measure is `ellProb K delta`, not the uniform measure on `K`.**  See the
   next section — this is the price, and it is not negotiable.

## The target measure: read this before composing with anything

The speedy walk's stationary distribution is `ellProb K delta`, the law with density
proportional to `ell` on `K`.  It is **not** `Arlib.uniformOn volume K`, and it is not the
uniform measure on any subset of `K` either.  Consequently:

* `ArlibCommunity.PointwiseRoute.theorem2_of_mixesWithin` — and therefore Kannan-Vempala Theorem 2 as
  formalised in this library — is stated for the *uniform* measure on `K`, and **nothing in
  this file composes with it.**  There is deliberately no `theorem2_of_lazy_speedyWalk`
  here: writing one would require a bridge from `ellProb K delta` to
  `Arlib.uniformOn volume K` that is not proved.
* Cousins-Vempala recover uniform samples from the speedy walk through the holding-time
  correspondence (the ball walk is the speedy walk with each state held a `Geom(ell(x))`
  number of steps, and `(density ∝ ell) × (mean holding time 1/ell) = uniform`).  That
  correspondence is **not formalised here**, and it is the one remaining structural gap
  between this file and a uniform sampler on `K`.
* `ellMeasure_le_volume_inter` and `ellMeasure_add_volume_le` quantify the gap
  unconditionally and without division: the density of `ellMeasure K delta` relative to
  Lebesgue measure on `K` is at most `1`, and its *local* deficit on any `S` is at most its
  *global* deficit `vol(K) - ∫_K ell`.  Under `Arlib.MarkovChains.IsSmooth K delta s` that
  global deficit is at most `s·vol(K)`, from which `ellProb K delta` and
  `Arlib.uniformOn volume K` are within `s/(1-s)` in total variation — an arithmetic step
  that is **not carried out in Lean here**, so no theorem below claims it.

`SpeedyPoints K delta = {x | 3/4 ≤ ell K delta x}` plays **no role** in any theorem below.
`three_quarters_le_ell_of_mem_speedyPoints` records that `ell ≥ 3/4` is free there — it is
literally the definition — but nothing consumes it, because the results need no lower bound
on `ell` at all.  This is deliberate: `K ⊆ SpeedyPoints K delta` is vacuous for a bounded `K`
(a supporting hyperplane at a boundary point forces `ell ≤ 1/2` there; that fact is *not*
formalised in this file), and restricting the walk to `K' = K ∩ SpeedyPoints K delta` only
moves the problem, since the overlap estimate for a walk living on `K'` would need
`K' ⊆ SpeedyPoints K' delta`, vacuous for the same reason.  The escape is not to restrict
the state space; it is the multiplicative overlap estimate of item 1 above.

## Scope: what is deliberately absent

There is **no `def`, `structure` or named `Prop` in this file asserting an isoperimetric
inequality, a conductance bound, a mixing bound, or a bound on `vol(K \ K')`.**  Every such
input is an inline `∀`-hypothesis of the theorem that consumes it.  The only `def`s are
`StuckPoints`, `speedyWalkAux`, `speedyWalk`, `ellMeasure` and `ellProb`, all plain
constructions.  There is no theorem here about the uniform measure on `K`.

A point `x` with `vol(B(x,δ) ∩ K) = 0` proposes only rejected points, so the speedy walk —
which is the ball walk conditioned on proposing an accepted point — is undefined there.  The

/-! ## 6. The multiplicative overlap estimate (convexity)

`volume_ball_le_volume_inter_ball_add` (`BallWalkConductance.lean`) says that two `δ`-balls
at centre distance `t` lose at most an `n t/(2δ)` fraction *of the ball* by intersecting.
That is an **additive** loss, and for the speedy walk it is useless: the one-step
distribution from `u` is normalised by `vol(B(u,δ) ∩ K)`, which may be far smaller than
`vol(B(u,δ))`, so a loss measured against the ball swamps it.

Convexity upgrades it to a **multiplicative** estimate against `vol(B(u,δ) ∩ K)` itself:
contracting `B(u,δ) ∩ K` towards the midpoint `m` of `u` and `v` by the factor
`λ = 1 - t/δ` lands it inside `B(u,δ) ∩ K ∩ B(v,δ)`, because `m ∈ K` (convexity) and every
contraction towards `m` stays in `K` (convexity again) while moving at most `(1-λ)·t/2`
closer to each centre.  Haar scaling turns the factor `λ` into `λⁿ` and Bernoulli turns
`λⁿ` into `1 - n t/δ`.

This is the elementary stand-in for Lemma 3.5 of [KLS95] (`vol3_journal.tex:592`), which
keeps a constant fraction at separation `δ/√n`; the contraction keeps a constant fraction
only at separation `δ/n`, which is the one factor of `√n` recorded as caveat 1 of
`BallWalkConductance.lean`. -/

/-- **The contraction towards the midpoint stays in both balls and in `K`.**  For a convex
`K` and `u, v ∈ K` at distance `t < δ`, the homothety of ratio `λ = 1 - t/δ` centred at the
midpoint maps `B(u,δ) ∩ K` into `B(u,δ) ∩ K ∩ B(v,δ)`.

The three membership checks are: `λ • y + (1-λ) • m ∈ K` by convexity; distance to `u` at
most `λ‖y-u‖ + (1-λ)t/2 < λδ + (1-λ)δ = δ`; and distance to `v` at most
`λ(‖y-u‖+t) + (1-λ)t/2 < δ`, which is where the choice `1 - λ = t/δ` is used. -/

/-! ## 7. One-step overlap for the speedy walk: no local-conductance hypothesis -/

/-- **The one-step overlap bound for the speedy walk.**  For a convex `K`, any `u, v ∈ K`
with `u` not stuck, and any measurable `T`,

    1  ≤  P_u(T) + P_v(Tᶜ) + n‖u - v‖/δ.

Compare `ell_le_ballWalk_add_ballWalk_compl`, where the left-hand side is `ell(u)`.  The
improvement is the whole point of the speedy walk: `P_u` divides by `vol(B(u,δ) ∩ K)`, and
`volume_inter_ball_le_of_convex` measures the overlap loss against the *same* quantity, so
the two cancel.  Consequently no hypothesis of the form `ell ≥ θ` appears anywhere
downstream.

The proof: both one-step laws dominate the uniform law on `C = B(u,δ) ∩ K ∩ B(v,δ)`,
normalised by at most `M = max(vol(B(u,δ) ∩ K), vol(B(v,δ) ∩ K))`; `T` and `Tᶜ` cut `C` in
two; and `volume_inter_ball_le_of_convex`, applied at whichever of `u, v` attains `M`, gives
`M ≤ vol(C) + (n t/δ)·M`.  Multiplying through by `M⁻¹` is the statement. -/

Three facts the conductance and mixing theorems need, none of them about the walk:

* the total `ell`-weight of a body of positive volume is positive, so `ellProb` is a genuine
  probability measure and not the zero measure;
* the stuck points carry no `ell`-weight, so they may be deleted from every covering
  argument;
* a probability measure absolutely continuous for Lebesgue measure has a measurable set of
  mass in `(0, 1/2]`, so the conductance is not the empty infimum `⊤` and `L²` contains a
  non-constant function. -/

If every ball of radius `δ/2` met `K` in a null set then a countable dense family of such
balls would cover `K` and force `vol(K) = 0`.  So some `A = K ∩ B(x₀, δ/2)` has positive
volume, and every `y ∈ A` has `B(x₀, δ/2) ⊆ B(y, δ)`, hence `ell(y) ≥ vol(A)/vol(δBₙ) > 0`.
Integrating that over `A` gives the claim.

Without this `ellProb` would be the zero measure and every statement about it vacuous. -/

/-- **A probability measure absolutely continuous for Lebesgue measure cuts `ℝⁿ` in half**:
some measurable set has mass in `(0, 1/2]`.

Suppose not; then every measurable set has mass `0` or more than `1/2`.  Let `R` be the
infimum of the radii `r` with `pi(B(0,r)) > 1/2`.  Every strictly smaller ball has mass `0`,
hence so does `B(0,R)` (a countable increasing union of them), while every strictly larger
ball has mass more than `1/2`.  The decreasing sets `B(0, R + 1/(k+1)) \ B(0,R)` therefore
all have mass more than `1/2` and intersect in the sphere `‖x‖ = R`, which is Lebesgue-null
and so `pi`-null.  Continuity from above gives `1/2 ≤ 0`.

This is the non-degeneracy `Arlib.MarkovChains.mixesWithin_of_conductance` needs, in a form
that applies to any target measure with a density — in particular to `ellProb`, which is
not uniform. -/

/-! ## 9. The conductance bound, with no local-conductance hypothesis

The proof is the three-way partition of `conductance_ballWalk_ge` (`vol3_journal.tex:657`),
with two changes.  First, the separation input is `lt_dist_of_speedyWalk_lt`, whose threshold
is the absolute constant `1/4` rather than `θ/4`, so **`hell` is gone**.  Second, the
stationary measure is `ellProb K δ`, so the isoperimetric hypothesis is stated for *that*
measure — which is the right thing to assume, since `ell` is a convolution of two indicators
of convex sets and hence log-concave, making `ellProb` a log-concave measure exactly like the
uniform measure on `K`.

The stuck points are deleted along with `Kᶜ` in every covering step; they are `ellProb`-null
(`ellProb_stuckPoints`), so nothing is lost. -/

/-- **The conductance of the speedy walk on a convex body**, given an isoperimetric
inequality for its stationary measure:

    Φ(speedy walk on K with δ-steps)  ≥  min(1/16, κ·δ/(128·n)).

The contrast with `conductance_ballWalk_ge` is the point of this file: **there is no
hypothesis of the form `ell ≥ θ`**, and correspondingly no `θ` in the bound.  The first
branch is an absolute constant instead of `θ/16`, and the second is `κδ/(128n)` instead of
`κθ²δ/(64n)`.  With the only *proved* witness for the ball walk's `θ` being `2⁻ⁿ`
(`ofReal_le_ell_unitBall`), that is the difference between an exponential and a polynomial
step count.

Hypotheses that carry content, all inline:

* `hconv` — **`K` is convex.**  Used only through `volume_inter_ball_le_of_convex`, and
  genuinely needed: without it the overlap loss is measured against `vol(B(u,δ))` rather than
  `vol(B(u,δ) ∩ K)` and the `θ` comes back.
* `hiso` — the **isoperimetric inequality for `ellProb K δ`**, spelled out.  Nothing here
  proves it; Mathlib has no isoperimetric inequality for log-concave densities
  (`CV-ROADMAP.md` §3).  Note it is stated for `ellProb K δ`, *not* for the uniform measure
  on `K`; those are different hypotheses.

The remaining hypotheses are non-degeneracy guards: `1 ≤ n`, `K` measurable with
`0 < vol(K) < ∞`, and `0 < δ`.

Against the paper (`vol3_journal.tex:746`, `Φ ≥ δ/(250σ√n)`): the shape `min(const, κd/const)`
is the same and the separation `d = δ/(2n)` replaces the paper's `δ/√n`, the one factor of
`√n` that the elementary contraction estimate costs against [KLS95, Lemma 3.5]. -/

/-! ## 10. End to end: the lazy speedy walk mixes -/

/-- **The lazy speedy walk on a convex `K` mixes to total variation `eps`, from an `M`-warm
start, in

    conductanceMixingTime M (min (1/32) (κ·δ/(256·n))) eps

steps** — i.e. `O(φ⁻² log(M/eps))` steps with `φ = min(1/32, κδ/(256n))`.

Compare `mixesWithin_lazy_ballWalk`, whose `φ` is `min(θ/32, κθ²δ/(128n))` and whose only
proved `θ` is `2⁻ⁿ`.  **Here there is no `θ`**, so the step count is
`O((n/(κδ))² log(M/eps))`: polynomial in `n` whenever `κ` and `δ` are.  The price is
convexity of `K` (`hconv`) and the target measure, which is `ellProb K δ` — see the module
docstring, and `ellMeasure_add_volume_le` for the quantitative comparison with the uniform
measure.

The only unproved input is `hiso`, written out inline; it is an isoperimetric inequality for
`ellProb K δ`, not for the uniform measure on `K`.

See `mixesWithin_lazy_speedyWalk_unitBall` for the check that the hypothesis bundle is
jointly satisfiable rather than vacuously composed. -/

/-! ## 11. Non-vacuity and the speedy-point hypothesis

Two checks.  First that the hypothesis bundle of `mixesWithin_lazy_speedyWalk` is jointly
satisfiable — the unit ball discharges everything except `hiso`.  Second, the promise of item
3 of the brief: on `SpeedyPoints K δ` the bound `ell ≥ 3/4` holds *by definition*, so it is
free rather than assumed.  Note where that lands: the results above need **no** lower bound
on `ell` at all, so the free `3/4` is not consumed anywhere.  It is recorded because it is
the hypothesis the ball-walk route needs and cannot get. -/

/-- **`ell ≥ 3/4` is free on `SpeedyPoints`, by definition.**  This is the analogue of
`hell` for the speedy walk, and it costs nothing — no geometry, no measurability, no
positivity.  Contrast `ofReal_le_ell_unitBall`, which is the *proved* witness for the ball
walk and gives only `θ = 2⁻ⁿ`.

It is deliberately not used below: `conductance_speedyWalk_ge` needs no lower bound on `ell`
whatsoever, because the reweighting has already divided it out.  The reason a lower bound
cannot simply be *assumed* at `θ = 3/4` is that `K ⊆ SpeedyPoints K δ` is vacuous for any
bounded body, and restricting the walk to `K' = K ∩ SpeedyPoints K δ` only moves the problem:
the overlap estimate for a walk living on `K'` needs `K' ⊆ SpeedyPoints K' δ`, which is
vacuous for the same reason. -/

is a concrete natural number.  What remains carried is exactly `hiso`.

Note what is *absent* compared with `mixesWithin_lazy_ballWalk_unitBall`: there is no `θ`,
so no exponentially small constant enters the step count. -/

/-! ## 12. How far `ellProb K δ` is from the uniform measure on `K`

The stationary measure of the speedy walk is `ell(x) dx / ∫_K ell`, not `dx / vol(K)`.  The
two lemmas below pin the difference **without any hypothesis**, in a subtraction-free form
that stays honest in `ℝ≥0∞`:

* `ellMeasure_le_volume_inter` — the unnormalised `ell`-weight of a set never exceeds its
  volume (`ell ≤ 1`);
* `ellMeasure_add_volume_le` — `vol(S ∩ K) + ∫_K ell ≤ ∫_{S∩K} ell + vol(K)`, i.e. the
  *deficit* `vol(S∩K) - ∫_{S∩K} ell` is at most the global deficit `vol(K) - ∫_K ell`.

Under `Arlib.MarkovChains.IsSmooth K δ s` the global deficit is at most `s·vol(K)`, so the
two measures agree to within `s/(1-s)` in total variation; that division is arithmetic and is
**not** carried out here, so no theorem in this file claims a total-variation bound between
`ellProb K δ` and `Arlib.uniformOn volume K`.  A caller who needs uniform samples on `K` must
supply that step (or the Cousins-Vempala holding-time correspondence) themselves. -/

/-- **The `ell`-weight of a set never exceeds its volume**, since `ell ≤ 1`. -/
theorem ellMeasure_le_volume_inter (K : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) (δ : ℝ)
    {S : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))} (hS : MeasurableSet S) :

/-- **The local deficit is at most the global deficit**:

    vol(S ∩ K) + ∫_K ell  ≤  ∫_{S ∩ K} ell + vol(K).

Both sides split over `S ∩ K` and `K \ S`, after which the claim is `∫_{K\S} ell ≤ vol(K\S)`.
This is the subtraction-free form of "the density of `ellMeasure` relative to Lebesgue
measure on `K` is within the smoothness deficit of the constant `1`". -/
