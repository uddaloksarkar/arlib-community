# Spectral independence gives a Poincaré inequality for the local walk

This is the module the whole spin-system half of the development was built to
reach.  The source monograph's `lem:QandPsi` — Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič,
Eric Vigoda, *Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques for Optimal
Mixing of Markov Chains*, arXiv:2307.13826 (2023), cited below as [CSV23] —
relates the local walk `Q_τ` at a pinning to the influence matrix `Ψ_τ` by
computing the *entire spectrum* of `Q_τ` from an `n`-partite block-matrix
decomposition, and reads off `λ₂(Q_τ) = (λ_max(Ψ_τ) − 1)/(n − k − 1)`; the
consequence actually consumed downstream is the Poincaré inequality
`γ_k ≥ 1 − η/(n − k − 1)` recorded alongside it.  Following `docs/dev/MarkovChains-ROADMAP.md` §1.2 we
never form `Ψ`, never mention a spectrum, and never invoke the block structure.
Instead everything follows from a single **exact identity** between the
Dirichlet form of the local walk and the covariance form of the conditional
measure, and the identity is proved by rearranging one double sum.

The identity is this.  Write `m = n − |Λ|` for the number of free sites, `π` for
the one-site-above distribution `π_{η,1}` (`Chains.PinnedGlauber.pinDist`), `Q`
for the local walk `Q_η` (`Chains.PinnedGlauber.pinLocalWalk`), `μ` for the
conditional Gibbs measure, and `f̃` for `f` restricted to the free sites.  Then
for *every* `f`

`ℰ_Q(f) = m/(m−1) · Var_π(f) − quadForm (Cov μ) f̃ / (m(m−1))`.

Nothing is assumed about `μ` beyond being a Gibbs measure of a nonnegative
weight; the identity is unconditional and holds entry-for-entry, degenerate rows
included.  Spectral independence enters only at the last step, as the bound
`quadForm (Cov μ) f̃ ≤ η · m · Var_π(f)`, and the constant `(m − η)/(m − 1)`
comes out.  In the monograph's normalisation (where our `η` is its `1 + η`, see
`Techniques.SpectralIndependence`) that is exactly `1 − η/(n − k − 1)`.

Two points are worth flagging, because both are places where the naive
computation fails.

*The centering is not optional and it is not a translation of `f`.*  The
covariance form is degenerate — `Cov_sum_right` says each block row sums to
zero — and the shift it tolerates is `a ↦ a + (a function of the site alone)`,
recorded here as `quadForm_Cov_add_site`.  Spectral independence bounds
`quadForm (Cov μ) a` by `η ∑_p marg p · a p²`, a *second moment*, not a
variance; to convert it into `Var_π` one must evaluate it at the vector that is
`f − Ex_π f` on free coordinates **and `0` on pinned ones**.  That vector is a
site-shift of `f̃` (the shift is `0` at pinned sites and `−Ex_π f` at free ones),
which is why `quadForm_Cov_add_site` and not plain translation invariance is
the lemma needed.  A plain translation `f̃ ↦ f̃ − c` would leave the pinned
coordinates charged with `marg p · c²` and lose the constant.

*The identity itself needs no centering.*  The `(∑_p marg p · f̃ p)²` produced by
`quadForm_joint` is exactly `m²·(Ex_π f)²`, and it combines with `⟪f,f⟫_π` to
give `Var_π(f)` on the nose.  So `dirichlet_pinLocalWalk` below is stated for
arbitrary `f`, with no mean-zero hypothesis.

* `numFree`, `freeRestrict` — the number `m = n − |Λ|` of free sites and the
  restriction of a vector on `V × S` to the free sites.
* `spinComb_add_site`, **`quadForm_Cov_add_site`** — the exact invariance the
  centering step uses: adding a function of the *site* to `a` shifts the linear
  statistic by a constant and leaves `quadForm (Cov μ)` alone.
* `marg_gibbs`, `joint_gibbs` — the dictionary between the marginals of
  `Techniques.SpectralIndependence` and the masses of `Chains.PinnedGlauber`.
* `spinEvent_eq_filter_agreesOn`, `spinEvent₂_eq_filter_agreesOn`,
  `marg_gibbs_eq_Z_pinWeight`, `joint_gibbs_eq_Z_pinWeight` — the same
  dictionary written with `Chains.Pinning` on the right: the one- and two-site
  marginals of a Gibbs measure are the partition functions of one- and two-site
  *pinnings*.  Nothing below uses these; they are the form in which a structural
  hypothesis on the weight becomes usable, and
  `Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence` is the consumer.
* `sum_joint_diag`, `sum_joint_offDiag`, `quadForm_joint_eq` — the three
  rearrangements of the double sum: the same-site blocks contribute
  `∑_p marg p · a p²`, and the unrestricted sum is
  `quadForm (Cov μ) a + (∑_p marg p · a p)²`.
* **`pinLocalWalk_eq_joint`** — the local walk written in the marginal/joint
  language, entry for entry.  On a free row with a charged marginal it is
  `joint μ x y / ((m−1)·marg μ x)`; on the degenerate rows (pinned site, null
  marginal) it is the identity row, *not* the formula.  Those rows carry no
  `π`-mass, so they are invisible to the Dirichlet form.
* `Ex_pinDist`, `ip_pinDist_self`, `ip_act_pinLocalWalk` — the three pieces.
* **`dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`** — the exact identity displayed above.
* `quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_le` — the centering step.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`** — the headline: `η`-spectral
  independence of the conditional measure gives the local walk a Poincaré
  constant `(m − η)/(m − 1)`.
* `spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_pinned` — the same, stated for `gibbsPin`.
  It is a one-line consequence, which is the design win of `Chains.Pinning`:
  a conditional Gibbs measure is a Gibbs measure, so `Cov` applies verbatim.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_empty`** — the empty pinning, where the
  constant is `(n − η)/(n − 1)`.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`, and no
eigenvalue, spectrum or Hermitian matrix appears anywhere.

/-! ## Free sites

A pinning `η` on `Λ` leaves the sites outside `Λ` free.  Both `π_{η,1}` and
`Q_η` are supported on the free (site, spin) pairs, so every sum below is really
a sum over free pairs; rather than carry a `Finset.filter` we multiply by the
indicator, which keeps all index sets equal to `univ` and all rearrangements
plain `Finset.sum_comm`. -/

/-! ## Site shifts of the covariance form

`Cov_sum_right` says every block row of `Cov μ` sums to zero, so the form is
degenerate in the directions "constant on the spins at a fixed site".  The
clean way to state and use that here is through `quadForm_Cov`: the covariance
form is the *variance* of the linear statistic `σ ↦ ∑_v a (v, σ v)`, and adding
a function of the site alone shifts that statistic by a constant. -/

`Cov_sum_right`, and it is what makes the centering step of the main theorem
legitimate: the vector used there is `f̃` shifted by `0` at pinned sites and by
`−Ex_π f` at free sites, which is a site shift but *not* a translation. -/

`Chains.Pinning` computes `Pr` of a pinned event as a ratio of partition
functions; composing that with the definitions of `marg` and `joint` expresses
both as pinned partition functions.  That is the form in which a *structural*
hypothesis on the weight can be used — `Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence`
consumes it, because `pinWeight` of a product weight is again a product
weight. -/

The Dirichlet form of `Q_η` sees the joint probabilities at *distinct* sites.
Splitting the unrestricted double sum into same-site and different-site parts,
evaluating the same-site part with `joint_self` and `joint_eq_zero_of_spin_ne`,
and expanding the unrestricted part with `quadForm_joint`, is the whole
computation. -/

/-! ## The local walk in the marginal/joint language

Before computing anything, check that `pinLocalWalk` really is the matrix the
argument expects.  It is — on the rows that carry mass.  On the two degenerate
kinds of row (a pinned site, a site/spin pair of null marginal) it is the
*identity row*, not the ratio `joint / ((m−1)·marg)`, which is `0/0` there.
Those rows are invisible: `π_{η,1}` gives them mass `0`. -/

/-- **The local walk, entry for entry.**

`Q_η(x, y) = joint μ x y / ((m − 1)·marg μ x)` when `x` is a free pair of
positive marginal and `y` is a free pair at a different site; `0` at every other
`y` on such a row; and the *identity row* `y ↦ [y = x]` when `x` is pinned or has
null marginal.

The last clause is a genuine discrepancy with the informal formula
`Q = joint/((m−1)·marg)`, which is undefined there.  It is harmless because
`pinDist` vanishes on exactly those rows (`pinDist_of_mem` and the null-marginal
branch of `pinDist_mul_pinLocalWalk`), so the Dirichlet form never evaluates
them. -/

/-! ## Centering, and the Poincaré inequality

Spectral independence bounds `quadForm (Cov μ) a` by a *second moment*
`η ∑_p marg p · a p²`.  The identity above wants a *variance*.  The bridge is
`quadForm_Cov_add_site`: evaluate the ordering not at `f̃` but at the vector
which is `f − Ex_π f` on free coordinates and `0` on pinned ones.  That vector
differs from `f̃` by a function of the site, so the left-hand side is unchanged,
while the right-hand side becomes `η · m · Var_π(f)` exactly. -/

/-- **The centering step.**

Under `η`-spectral independence of the conditional measure,
`quadForm (Cov μ) f̃ ≤ η · m · Var_{π_{η,1}}(f)`.

The pinned coordinates would contribute `marg p · c²` to the right-hand side if
one merely translated `f̃` by a constant `c`, which would lose the constant; the
vector used instead vanishes at pinned sites, and `quadForm_Cov_add_site` says
the left-hand side does not notice. -/

/-- **Spectral independence implies a Poincaré inequality for the local walk.**

This is the eigenvalue-free form of [CSV23, `lem:QandPsi`] and, more precisely,
of the consequence stated alongside it.  If the conditional
Gibbs measure `μ_η` is `η`-spectrally independent, then the local walk `Q_η` on
one-site extensions of the pinning has Poincaré constant at least

`(m − η)/(m − 1)`,   `m = n − |Λ|`.

Recalling the constant convention of `Techniques.SpectralIndependence` — our `η`
is the monograph's `1 + η` — this reads
`1 − η_monograph/(n − |Λ| − 1)`, which is the monograph's `γ_k ≥ 1 − η/(n−k−1)`
at `k = |Λ|`.

No eigenvalue, no spectrum, no block decomposition: the whole content is
`dirichlet_pinLocalWalk` plus `quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_le`. -/

/-! ### The conditional instance

The theorem above is stated for an arbitrary nonnegative weight `w`, with the
set `Λ` entering only through the counting of free sites.  The instance the
local-to-global induction wants is `w = pinWeight w₀ Λ τ`, where `gibbs w` is
the conditional measure `μ_τ` and `Cov` is its covariance form.  Because
`Chains.Pinning` keeps conditioning inside the category of weights, that
instance needs no separate proof — this corollary is one application. -/

/-- **The pinned form of the headline.**  If the conditional Gibbs measure
`μ_τ = gibbsPin w hw Λ τ` is `c`-spectrally independent, the local walk at that
pinning has Poincaré constant `(m − c)/(m − 1)` with `m = n − |Λ|`.

This is the statement the local-to-global induction of the monograph's §6
consumes at every level, and it is a one-line consequence: `Cov` applies to
`gibbsPin` verbatim because a conditional Gibbs measure is a Gibbs measure. -/

The headline case, and the one the monograph proves in full
([CSV23, `lem:QandPsi`]: "we will prove the lemma for the case without a
pinning").  Here `m = n`
and the constant is `(n − η)/(n − 1)`.  Note that `pinLocalWalk` carries
`|Λ| + 1 < n` in its data, so at `Λ = ∅` the hypothesis is `2 ≤ n`: with a
single site there is no other site to walk to and the local walk does not
exist. -/
