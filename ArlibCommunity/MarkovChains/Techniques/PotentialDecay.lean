# Geometric decay of a potential under a drift condition

The `L²` machinery of this area measures convergence of a chain to *stationarity*.
A perfect-sampling argument needs something different and much cruder: a
guarantee that the chain has *reached a target set*, with a tail bound on how
long it takes.  The standard elementary device for that is a Lyapunov (or
supermartingale) potential, and this module contains it in the smallest form
that is actually useful.

The input is a nonnegative function `Φ : Ω → ℝ` and a *drift condition*

  `(K Φ)(x) ≤ lam · Φ(x)` for every `x`,

i.e. one step of the chain multiplies the potential by at most `lam`.  Since
`act` is monotone and positive, this self-improves: `t` steps multiply `Φ` by at
most `lam ^ t` (`act_iter_le_of_drift`).  Combining that with a one-line finite
Markov inequality turns the potential into a hitting-time tail bound
(`not_reached_le_of_drift`): if `Φ ≥ 1` off a target set `T`, then the chain
started at `x₀` is still outside `T` at time `t` with probability at most
`lam ^ t · Φ(x₀)`.

* `act_mono`, `act_nonneg` — positivity and monotonicity of the one-step
  operator, the only structural facts the argument uses.
* `act_iter_le_of_drift` — the headline: `K^t Φ ≤ lam^t Φ` pointwise.
* `sum_push_mul` — the adjoint bookkeeping `⟨νK, f⟩ = ⟨ν, Kf⟩`.
* `expectation_iter_le_of_drift` — the same statement read as an expectation
  against a starting distribution.
* `not_reached_le_of_drift` — the Markov-inequality corollary.

Nothing here is specific to any chain, and nothing here uses reversibility, a
stationary distribution, or a spectral gap; in particular no eigenvalue appears,
in keeping with the standing commitment of this area.  Everything is proved from
first principles with no `sorry`.

The intended consumer is `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.SinusoidalPotential`,
where `Φ` is Wilson's sinusoidal potential and the drift condition is a
trigonometric identity.

/-- **Geometric decay of a potential under a drift condition.**  If a nonnegative
potential `Φ` contracts by a factor `lam` in one step of the kernel, then it
contracts by `lam ^ t` in `t` steps.

The induction is the whole proof: `K^{t+1} Φ = K (K^t Φ) ≤ K (lam^t Φ) =
lam^t · K Φ ≤ lam^{t+1} Φ`, where the first inequality is monotonicity of `act`
and the second is the hypothesis.  Nonnegativity of `Φ` is not needed for *this*
statement — the drift hypothesis already carries all the information — but it is
kept in the signature because it is what makes the conclusion meaningful, and
every downstream consumer has it. -/

This is the form in which a Lyapunov potential is actually consumed by a
perfect-sampling analysis: `T` is the set of "collapsed" states and `Φ` is a
potential that is large far from `T` and drifts down. -/
