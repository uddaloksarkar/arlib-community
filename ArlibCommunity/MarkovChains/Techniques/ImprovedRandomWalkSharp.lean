# The Improved Random Walk Theorem with the sharp factor `γ/(2 - γ)`

`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` proves the Improved Random Walk Theorem with the
level factor `2γ_j - 1`.  That factor is the monograph's — Zongchen Chen, Daniel
Štefankovič, Eric Vigoda, *Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques
for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains*, arXiv:2307.13826 (2023), cited below as
[CSV23] — but the monograph says twice, the second time in the closing remark of
the proof of `lem:improved-technical`, that it is *not* the best its own argument
gives:
keeping the bound `1/(1 - γ_{k-1}/2)` in `missing-step` instead of weakening it
to `2γ_{k-1}` replaces `2γ_j - 1` by **`γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`** throughout, which is the
form of `[CLV21, Fact A.8 and Theorem A.9]` — Zongchen Chen, Kuikui Liu, Eric
Vigoda, *Optimal Mixing of Glauber Dynamics: Entropy Factorization via
High-Dimensional Expanders*, STOC 2021 (arXiv:2011.02075).  This module carries
out that replacement.

**Why it matters, and where.**  The induction of the Improved Random Walk Theorem
multiplies through by its level factor, so the factor must be nonnegative.  With
`2γ_j - 1` that is the hypothesis `γ_j ≥ 1/2`; with `γ_j/(2 - γ_j)` it is
`γ_j ≥ 0`, which is free.  `Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing` pays for the
difference: its level gaps are `γ_j = (d + 1 - η)/d` with `d ≥ 1` the number of
free sites minus one, so `γ_j ≥ 1/2` binds at `d = 1`, where it reads `η ≤ 3/2`,
and the constant is `0` exactly there.  The sharp factor is
`(d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)` (`sharpStep_free_sites`), which is *positive* for every
`d ≥ 1` as soon as `0 < η < 2` (`sharpStep_free_sites_pos`) — the monograph's
classical `|η₀| < 1`.

**The one-line reason the sharp factor is better** is
`sharpStep γ - (2γ - 1) = 2(γ - 1)²/(2 - γ)`, the identity
`sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one`.  The old proof in `ImprovedRandomWalk` discards
exactly this: its final step is `2γ(1 - γ/2) = 1 - (γ-1)² ≤ 1`.  So the two
factors agree only at `γ = 1`, and the gain is second order in `γ - 1` and blows
up as `γ ↑ 2`.

**Where `γ < 2` is needed, and where it is not.**  Nowhere in the *analysis*.  The
per-face step is kept division-free in the stronger form
`2·Var_{π_{τ,1}} ≤ (2 - γ)·Var_{π_{τ,2}}` — the monograph's
`Var_{π_{τ,2}} ≥ (1/(1 - γ/2))·Var_{π_{τ,1}}` with the division cleared — and
that inequality, and the averaged `γ·ℰ_k ≤ (2 - γ)·ℰ_{k+1}` it gives, hold for
*every real* `γ`, with no sign or size hypothesis at all
(`two_mul_Var_pi_le_of_downUp_gap`, `mul_levelEnergy_le_of_downUp_gap`).  Even the
divided form `sharpStep γ · ℰ_k ≤ ℰ_{k+1}` needs no hypothesis on `γ`, because at
`γ = 2` Lean's `x/0 = 0` and above `2` the factor is negative, while both level
energies are nonnegative.  `γ ≤ 2` is needed only for `0 ≤ sharpStep γ`, i.e. only
by the induction, and **`γ < 2` strictly** is needed only for the comparison
`2γ - 1 ≤ sharpStep γ`.

**`γ = 2` is real, and there the old factor wins.**  At `γ = 2` the sharp factor is
`2/0 = 0`: the per-level inequality survives (`0 ≤ ℰ_{k+1}`), but `Γ` collapses and
the theorem becomes vacuous, whereas `2γ - 1 = 3` there.  This is not a corner
case invented for the docstring: `Chains.BernoulliLaplace.blGamma N j =
(N-j)/(N-j-1)` is exactly `2` at the top level `j + 2 = N` (as
`Chains.BernoulliLaplace.blGamma_le_two` says in as many words), and that is one
of the only two chains this library instantiates the theorem against.  So
the sharp version does **not** dominate the old one; it dominates it on `0 ≤ γ < 2`
and loses at `γ = 2` (`sharpStep_two_lt_two_mul_sub_one`).  Both are kept.

**Main declarations.**

* `sharpStep` — the level factor `γ/(2 - γ)`, with `sharpStep_nonneg`,
  `sharpStep_two`.
* **`sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one`** — `sharpStep γ - (2γ - 1) = 2(γ-1)²/(2-γ)`,
  and hence **`two_mul_sub_one_le_sharpStep`**: the new factor is never smaller,
  for `γ < 2`.  `sharpStep_two_lt_two_mul_sub_one` is the witness that `γ < 2`
  cannot be dropped.
* `sharpStep_free_sites`, `sharpStep_free_sites_pos` — the factor at the level gaps
  spectral independence produces, and the range `0 < η < 2` on which it is
  positive.
* `sharpFactor` with `sharpFactor_zero`, `sharpFactor_succ`, `sharpFactor_nonneg`,
  `one_le_sum_sharpFactor` — `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`.
* **`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div`** — the whole point of the module:
  the constant proved here is never smaller than the one
  `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` proves, denominators included.
* `two_mul_Var_pi_le_of_downUp_gap`, `two_mul_Var_linkShiftPiOf_one_le_of_gap` —
  `missing-step`, kept in its undivided form.
* **`mul_levelEnergy_le_of_downUp_gap`** and
  **`sharpStep_mul_levelEnergy_le_of_downUp_gap`** — `lem:improved-technical`
  sharpened: `γ·ℰ_k ≤ (2-γ)·ℰ_{k+1}`, equivalently `(γ/(2-γ))·ℰ_k ≤ ℰ_{k+1}`.
* `sharpStep_mul_levelEnergy_le_of_upDown_gap`,
  `sharpStep_mul_levelEnergy_le_of_localWalk_gap` — the same with the local
  hypothesis in the two forms the rest of the development produces.
* `sharpFactor_mul_levelVar_le` — `induct:simpler` with the sharp factor.
* **`downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast_sharp`**,
  **`downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast_sharp_of_upDown_gap`** and
  **`downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast_sharp_of_localWalk_gap`** — the **Improved
  Random Walk Theorem**, `γ(P^∨∧_{m+1}) ≥ Γ_m/∑_{i≤m} Γ_i` with
  `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`, under `0 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2` in place of
  `1/2 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2`.

There is no `sorry` in this file, and no eigenvalue anywhere in its proofs.

/-! ## The sharp level factor, and the comparison with `2γ - 1`

Nothing in this section mentions a complex; it is the arithmetic that justifies
the module.  The two facts to keep in mind are that `sharpStep` dominates
`2γ - 1` by `2(γ-1)²/(2-γ)` *below* `2`, and that at `γ = 2` it is `0` by Lean's
division convention and so is dominated instead. -/

/-- **The sharp level factor `γ/(2 - γ)`** of `[CLV21, Fact A.8]`, the factor the
monograph's `lem:improved-technical` produces when the bound `1/(1 - γ/2)` in
`missing-step` is kept rather than weakened to `2γ`.

At `γ = 2` this is `2/0 = 0` by Lean's convention, which is *sound* for every
statement below — the per-level inequality still holds, because a level energy is
nonnegative — but makes the resulting constant vacuous.  See the module
docstring. -/
noncomputable def sharpStep (γ : ℝ) : ℝ := γ / (2 - γ)

/-- The sharp factor is nonnegative on `0 ≤ γ ≤ 2`, the right endpoint included
by the division convention.  This is the *only* place the induction below needs a
hypothesis on `γ`. -/
theorem sharpStep_nonneg {γ : ℝ} (h0 : 0 ≤ γ) (h2 : γ ≤ 2) : 0 ≤ sharpStep γ :=

/-- `sharpStep 2 = 0`: at `γ = 2` the sharp factor degenerates. -/
@[simp] theorem sharpStep_two : sharpStep 2 = 0 := by
  rw [sharpStep]; norm_num

/-- **The exact gain of the sharp factor over the monograph's**, for `γ < 2`:

  **`γ/(2 - γ) - (2γ - 1) = 2(γ - 1)²/(2 - γ)`.**

This identity *is* the discarded step of
`ImprovedRandomWalk.two_mul_Var_pi_succ_le`, whose last line is
`2γ(1 - γ/2) = 1 - (γ - 1)² ≤ 1`.  The two factors therefore agree exactly at
`γ = 1`, the gain is quadratic in `γ - 1` near it, and it diverges as `γ ↑ 2`. -/
theorem sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one {γ : ℝ} (h : γ < 2) :

/-- **The sharp factor is never smaller than the monograph's**, on `γ < 2`.
Immediate from `sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one`, since the gain
`2(γ-1)²/(2-γ)` is a quotient of nonnegatives there.

This single inequality is what makes every constant proved in this module at
least as large as the corresponding constant of
`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk`; `improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div` carries
it through the products and the sums. -/

  have := sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one h
  linarith

/-- **`γ < 2` cannot be dropped from `two_mul_sub_one_le_sharpStep`.**  At `γ = 2`
the sharp factor is `0` and the monograph's is `3`, so the comparison reverses.
This is not a vacuous boundary: `Chains.BernoulliLaplace.blGamma` takes the value
`2` at its top level.  It is the reason `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` is not
subsumed by this module. -/
theorem sharpStep_two_lt_two_mul_sub_one : sharpStep 2 < 2 * 2 - 1 := by
  rw [sharpStep_two]; norm_num

/-- **The sharp factor at the level gaps that spectral independence produces.**
If `d` free sites minus one give the local gap `γ = (d + 1 - η)/d` — the shape of
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.siGamma` — then

  **`sharpStep γ = (d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)`,**

to be compared with `2γ - 1 = (d + 2 - 2η)/d`.  Stated over the reals, with no
reference to any chain: it is the arithmetic identity `a/d / (2 - a/d) =
a/(2d - a)`.

No hypothesis on `d - 1 + η` is needed.  At `d - 1 + η = 0` — that is, at the
level gap `γ = 2` — both sides are `0` by the division convention, which is the
degeneracy the module docstring warns about, recorded here as an equality rather
than as a missing case. -/
theorem sharpStep_free_sites {d η : ℝ} (hd : d ≠ 0) :
    sharpStep ((d + 1 - η) / d) = (d + 1 - η) / (d - 1 + η) := by
  have hstep : 2 - (d + 1 - η) / d = (d - 1 + η) / d := by
    field_simp; ring
  rw [sharpStep, hstep, div_div_div_cancel_right₀]
  exact hd

/-- **The range the sharp factor buys.**  For every `d ≥ 1` and every `0 < η < 2`
the sharp factor of the level gap `(d + 1 - η)/d` is *strictly positive*; the
monograph's `2γ - 1 = (d + 2 - 2η)/d` is instead negative for `η > 1 + d/2`,
which at the binding level `d = 1` is `η > 3/2`.

So on this family the hypothesis of the Improved Random Walk Theorem moves from
`η ≤ 3/2` to `η < 2`, and the lower end `0 < η` is new: the sharp factor is
undefined (Lean: `0`) at `η = 0, d = 1`, where the level gap is exactly `2`. -/

/-! ## `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`, and the comparison of the two constants

The bookkeeping is that of `ImprovedRandomWalk.improvedFactor`, with `2γ_j - 1`
replaced by `sharpStep (γ j)`.  The one genuinely new lemma is
`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div`: comparing the *factors* is not enough,
because the constant `Γ_m/∑_{i≤m}Γ_i` has the factors in its denominator too, so
increasing them could in principle hurt.  It does not, and the reason is that the
comparison holds term by term after cross-multiplying. -/

/-- **The sharp analogue of `ImprovedRandomWalk.improvedFactor`**:
`Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`, the `Γ` of `[CLV21, Theorem A.9]`. -/

Both sides share the common head `Γ^{old}_i · Γ^{new}_i ≥ 0`, and what is left is
`∏_{i ≤ j < m}(2γ_j - 1) ≤ ∏_{i ≤ j < m} γ_j/(2-γ_j)`.  Rather than split the
products, the proof inducts on `m`, which keeps every step a single application
of `two_mul_sub_one_le_sharpStep` against a nonnegative multiplier. -/

This is the lemma that justifies the module.  Note that it is not a formality:
the sharp factors are larger, but they occur in the denominator as well, so the
comparison has to be made after cross-multiplying, where it becomes
`improvedFactor_mul_sharpFactor_le` summed over `i ≤ m`.

`2γ·Var_{π_k}(U_k g) ≤ Var_{π_{k+1}}(g)`, throwing away `(γ-1)²·Var_{π_{k+1}}(g)`
at the last step.  The inequality *before* that step is
`Var_{π_k}(U_k g) ≤ (1 - γ/2)·Var_{π_{k+1}}(g)`, which is the monograph's
`1/(1 - γ_{k-1}/2)` bound with the division cleared.  Kept in that form it needs
no hypothesis on `γ` whatsoever — not even `0 ≤ γ` — and it is what the rest of
this module runs on. -/

The proof is two lines: `LevelVariance.Var_pi_succ_eq` splits `Var_{π_{k+1}}(g)`
as `Var_{π_k}(U_k g) + ℰ_{P^∨∧_k}(g)`, and the hypothesis bounds the second
summand below by `(γ/2)·Var_{π_{k+1}}(g)`.  Compare

The averaging step is unchanged from `ImprovedRandomWalk`: both sides are
`π_k`-averages already identified with level energies in `Techniques.FirstStep`,
and the per-face bound is fed to `Ex_mono_of_ne_zero` (not `Ex_mono` — a face of
`π_k`-mass zero need not satisfy it, since the two guarded distributions can
degenerate independently there).  Only the arithmetic afterwards differs:

same local hypothesis as `ImprovedRandomWalk.levelEnergy_ge_of_downUp_gap`,

  **`γ·ℰ_{P^∨∧_k}(f^{(k+1)}) ≤ (2 - γ)·ℰ_{P^∨∧_{k+1}}(f^{(k+2)})`.**

Dividing by `2 - γ > 0` gives the monograph's sharp form
`ℰ_{k+1} ≥ (γ/(2-γ))·ℰ_k`; the undivided statement holds for every real `γ` and
is the primitive here.

Compare `ImprovedRandomWalk.levelEnergy_ge_of_downUp_gap`, which concludes
`(2γ - 1)·ℰ_k ≤ ℰ_{k+1}`: that is this statement with `(2 - γ)` moved across by
`2γ - 1 ≤ γ/(2 - γ)`. -/

surprisingly — it needs **no hypothesis on `γ` at all**.  Three cases:

* `γ < 2`: divide, the division is by a positive number;
* `γ = 2`: `sharpStep 2 = 0` and a level energy is nonnegative
  (`LocalToGlobal.levelEnergy_nonneg`), so the claim is `0 ≤ ℰ_{k+1}`;
* `γ > 2`: `sharpStep γ < 0` and `ℰ_k ≥ 0`, so the left side is nonpositive.

Only the last two cases use nonnegativity of the level energies, and only they
would fail if `sharpStep` were treated as undefined outside `[0, 2)`. -/

/-! ## The Improved Random Walk Theorem, sharpened

The induction is that of `ImprovedRandomWalk.improvedFactor_mul_levelVar_le`,
with `2γ_m - 1` replaced by `γ_m/(2 - γ_m)` in both of the multiplications it
performs.  The nonnegativity side conditions the monograph does not state are
therefore `0 ≤ γ_j/(2 - γ_j)` rather than `0 ≤ 2γ_j - 1`, i.e. `0 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2`
rather than `1/2 ≤ γ_j`. -/

/-- **`induct:simpler` with the sharp factor.**  For every `m < n`,

  **`Γ_m·Var_{π_{m+1}}(f^{(m+1)}) ≤ (∑_{i≤m} Γ_i)·ℰ_{P^∨∧_m}(f^{(m+1)})`,**
  `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`.

Base case `m = 0`: `Var_{π_0} = 0`, so `levelVar_succ` reads
`Var_{π_1}(f^{(1)}) = ℰ_{P^∨∧_0}(f^{(1)})`.  Step: multiply
`sharpStep_mul_levelEnergy_le_of_downUp_gap` by `∑_{i≤m} Γ_i ≥ 0`, multiply the
inductive hypothesis by `Γ_{m+1}/Γ_m = γ_m/(2 - γ_m) ≥ 0`, and reassemble.  The
two nonnegativity conditions are the only use of `0 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2`. -/

/-- **The Improved Random Walk Theorem with the sharp factor**, `eqn:RW-one-improved`
in the form of `[CLV21, Theorem A.9]`.  For a weighted complex of dimension
`m + 1` whose links all have the stated local gap,

  **`γ(P^∨∧_{m+1}) ≥ Γ_m / ∑_{i≤m} Γ_i`,  `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`.**

The hypotheses on the level gaps are `0 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2`, where
`ImprovedRandomWalk.downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast` requires `1/2 ≤ γ_j`; and by
`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div` the constant here is at least the one
proved there, whenever both apply *and* `γ_j < 2`.

At `γ_j = 2` the sharp constant is `0` while the old one is not — see
`sharpStep_two_lt_two_mul_sub_one` and the module docstring.  This is the one
regime in which `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` remains strictly stronger. -/
