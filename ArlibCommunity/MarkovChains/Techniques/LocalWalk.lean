# Stars of faces, and the local walk

The local-to-global technique (§5.1 of the monograph) is an induction on the
levels of a weighted complex in which the inductive step is applied not to the
complex itself but to the *link* of a face: the complex obtained by conditioning
on containing a fixed face `τ`.  This module makes that step available, and it is
where the standing caveat of the area lives, so it is stated first.

**What is built here is the star of `τ`, not its link.**  `starWeight w τ` is `w`
restricted to the faces *containing* `τ`, on the same ground set and at the same
dimension `n`.  Its faces at level `j` are all `j`-subsets of the top faces
through `τ` — **including subsets that meet `τ`** — so `starPi w n j τ` charges
faces `ρ ⊆ τ`, which the monograph's `π_{τ,j}` must not
(`LinkRestriction.starPi_apply_of_subset`).  The link proper has dimension
`n − |τ|` and its faces are disjoint from `τ`; that is
`Techniques.LinkRestriction.linkShift`, and `linkShiftPi` is `π_{τ,j}`.

**The two agree at level one, and level one is all this module's downstream
consumers use.**  `linkDist` below is the honest `π_{τ,1}` — it is defined
directly, gives mass `0` to elements of `τ`, and is audited against the link's
own level-one distribution by `LinkRestriction.linkShiftPi_one_singleton`.  So
`localWalk`, its reversibility, and the `Q_η` bridge in `Chains.PinnedGlauber`
are unaffected by the star/link distinction.  It is `starPi` at `j ≥ 2` that is
not a link distribution, and nothing in the development consumes it there.

With that said, the star is a genuinely useful object, and the reason is a
triviality worth stating precisely: the star of `τ` is *again a weighted complex
on the same ground set and of the same dimension*.  This is exactly what
`Chains.Pinning` found for conditional Gibbs measures — **conditioning does not
leave the category** — so no new theory is needed and every result of
`Techniques.Levels` applies to it verbatim.  The only bookkeeping is a
normalisation: `starWeight w τ` sums to `mu w τ` rather than to `1`, so the
distributions are built from the normalised weight
`starWeightNorm w τ = starWeight w τ / mu w τ`.  The operators `up`, `down`,
`upDown`, `downUp` need no normalisation at all, since `Levels` never asks them
for `hsum`.

The workhorse is `mu_starWeight`: the derived weights of the star are the derived
weights of the original complex, shifted by `τ`.  Together with
`starWeight_union` — stars compose — it is what lets the local-to-global
induction descend one level at a time.

* `starWeight`, `starWeight_nonneg`, `starWeight_supp`, `starWeight_empty`,
  `starWeight_top`, `sum_starWeight` — the star weight and its elementary
  properties.  `sum_starWeight` is its partition function:
  `∑ σ, starWeight w τ σ = mu w τ`.
* `mu_starWeight` — **the workhorse**: `mu (starWeight w τ) ρ = mu w (τ ∪ ρ)`.
  Both sides are `∑ σ, if τ ∪ ρ ⊆ σ then w σ else 0` by `Finset.union_subset_iff`.
* `starWeight_union` — **stars compose**:
  `starWeight (starWeight w τ) ρ = starWeight w (τ ∪ ρ)`.
* `starWeightNorm` and `starWeightNorm_nonneg`, `starWeightNorm_supp`,
  `sum_starWeightNorm`, `mu_starWeightNorm` — the normalised star weight
  satisfies *all three* hypotheses of `Levels`.
* `starPi`, `starUp`, `starDown`, `starUpDown`, `starDownUp` — the level
  distributions and the four operators of the star complex, together with
  `star_up_down_adjoint`, `starUpDown_reversible`, `starUpDown_nonnegDefinite`,
  `starDownUp_reversible`, `starDownUp_nonnegDefinite`, … .  Each is one line:
  "apply `Levels` to the star".  Read `starPi w n j τ` as the level-`j`
  distribution of the *star*, and use `LinkRestriction.linkShiftPi` when the
  monograph's `π_{τ,j}` is wanted.
* `linkDist` — the paper's `π_{τ,1}`, the distribution one level above `τ` on
  ground-set elements: mass `mu w (insert e τ) / ((n - k) · mu w τ)` at `e ∉ τ`,
  and `0` at `e ∈ τ`.  This *is* the link's level-one distribution, transported
  along `e ↦ {e}`; it is not built from `starWeight`.  It is a distribution by
  `Levels.sum_insert_mu`, which exists for exactly this purpose.  The monograph
  only ever uses `j = 1`, so no general `π_{τ,j}` is built here.
* `linkDistOf` — the **guarded** variant of `linkDist`, added beside it rather
  than in place of it: total in `τ`, so that it can appear inside an average over
  a whole level, at the price of a `[Nonempty E]` instance for its junk value.
  The instance is unavoidable — `FinDist E` is an empty type when `E` is — and
  free, by `Levels.nonempty_of_weight`.
* `localWalk` — the local walk `Q_τ` on ground-set elements, which from `e`
  jumps to `e' ∉ τ ∪ {e}` with probability proportional to
  `mu w (τ ∪ {e, e'})`, with `linkDist_mul_localWalk` and
  **`localWalk_reversible`**, `localWalk_stationary`.

**Two deliberate choices.**  First, `localWalk` is defined directly rather than
as a walk of the star complex.  The tempting route — "`Q_τ` is `downUp` at the
bottom level" — is not available: `downUp _ n 0` first steps deterministically
down to `∅` and then goes up, so it is the *independent sampler* for the level-`1`
distribution and does not depend on its current state, whereas `Q_τ` does.  The
walk that is genuinely built from the operators is `upDown` at level `1`, and the
monograph's own computation (`rem:local-downup`) shows that this is
`(Q_τ + I)/(k+1)`-shaped, not `Q_τ`.  `Techniques.LocalWalkBridge` carries that
computation out, for the *link* rather than the star.  Second, `Q_τ` is *not*
asserted to be positive semidefinite, and indeed it is not: it is the
non-backtracking walk, and the monograph records `-1/(n-k-1)` in its spectrum.
Positive semidefiniteness in this development belongs to the up-down and down-up
walks, where `Techniques.Adjoint` supplies it for free.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## The star weight

Conditioning a weighted complex on containing a face `τ` restricts the top-level
weight to the **star** of `τ` — the faces containing `τ`.  The result is a weight
on the same ground set, supported on the same level `n`; only the normalisation
changes.  It is *not* the link, whose dimension is `n − |τ|`; see
`Techniques.LinkRestriction` and the module docstring. -/

/-- The **star weight** of a face `τ`: the top-level weight `w` restricted to the
faces containing `τ`.  This is the top-level weight of the star complex, which
lives on the same ground set and has the same dimension as the original.

This is **not** the link of `τ`, which lives one dimension lower and whose faces
are disjoint from `τ`; that is `LinkRestriction.linkShift`. -/

/-! ### The guarded one-level-up distribution

`linkDist w n τ hw hsupp hpos hk` requires `hpos : 0 < mu w τ` and
`hk : τ.card < n` *in its data*, so there is literally no term at a null face.
That is fine for statements about a single face, but it blocks any statement
that *averages over faces*, even though the null faces carry no `π_k`-mass.
`linkDistOf` removes the obstruction by guarding both hypotheses and falling
back on a point mass.

This is added *beside* `linkDist`, not in place of it: the hypotheses-in-data
form is what `linkDist_mul_localWalk` and `localWalk_reversible` consume, and
those need no `[Nonempty E]` instance. -/

section Guarded

variable [Nonempty E]

/-- The **guarded one-level-up distribution** `π_{τ,1}`: `linkDist` where that is
defined, and a point mass at an arbitrary element of `E` elsewhere.

Unlike `linkDist` this is a total function of the face `τ`, so it can appear
inside a `π_k`-average.  The junk value is invisible to every statement using
it, because a face at which either guard fails has `π_k`-mass `0`.

The `[Nonempty E]` hypothesis is what makes the junk value exist at all — the
type `FinDist E` is empty when `E` is — and `Levels.nonempty_of_weight` shows it
is implied by the standing hypotheses of a complex of positive dimension. -/

/-! ## The local walk

The local walk `Q_τ` is the non-backtracking walk one level above `τ`: from
`e ∉ τ` it jumps to `e' ∉ τ ∪ {e}` with probability proportional to
`mu w (τ ∪ {e, e'})`.  Its guard structure mirrors `Levels.up` exactly: the two
degenerate branches (a null face, or an element of `τ`) hold in place, purely so
that the matrix is stochastic on all of `E`. -/

/-- The **local walk** `Q_τ` at a face `τ` with `τ.card + 1 < n`:

`Q_τ(e, e') = mu w (τ ∪ {e, e'}) / ((n - k - 1) · mu w (τ ∪ {e}))`

for `e ∉ τ` with `mu w (insert e τ) > 0` and `e' ∉ τ ∪ {e}`, and `0` for
`e' ∈ τ ∪ {e}` — in particular the diagonal vanishes, which is what
"non-backtracking" means.  The row sum is `Levels.sum_insert_mu` applied to the
face `insert e τ`, of cardinality `k + 1`. -/

if the guard is off because `mu w (insert e τ) = 0`, the numerator on the right
