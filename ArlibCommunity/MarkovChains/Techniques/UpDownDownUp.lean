# The two composites of an adjoint pair have the same spectral gap

`lem:updown-downup` of the source monograph asserts `γ(P^∧∨_{k-1}) = γ(P^∨∧_k)`:
the up-down walk on level `k` and the down-up walk on level `k + 1` have the same
spectral gap.  The monograph proves it by "the nonzero spectrum of `AB` equals the
nonzero spectrum of `BA`", which is exactly the route the design principles of
this area forbid.  This module supplies the elementary replacement, and supplies
it at the right generality: nothing about the two composites of a *mutually
adjoint pair* `Adjoint μ ν K L` is special to the up and down operators of a
weighted complex.

The argument is Cauchy–Schwarz applied twice, once in each direction, and it
never leaves the world of squared norms — no `Real.sqrt` appears.  Writing
`γ · Var ≤ ℰ` in the equivalent "norm" form `‖L f‖² ≤ (1 - γ)‖f‖²` on mean-zero
`f`, adjointness gives

  `‖K g‖²_μ = ⟪g, L (K g)⟫_ν ≤ ‖g‖_ν · ‖L (K g)‖_ν`  and  `‖L (K g)‖²_ν ≤ (1-γ)‖K g‖²_μ`,

so `‖K g‖⁴ ≤ ‖g‖² (1-γ) ‖K g‖²`, and dividing by `‖K g‖²` (or observing that the
conclusion is trivial when it vanishes) gives `‖K g‖² ≤ (1-γ)‖g‖²`.

* `Adjoint.Ex_act_left` — `μ(K g) = ν(g)`: the functional form of
  `Adjoint.push_left`, which is what keeps "mean-zero" mean-zero across `K`.
* `Adjoint.spectralGapAtLeast_comp_iff_norm` — **the translation**, both
  directions: `SpectralGapAtLeast μ (K ∘ₖ L) γ` holds iff
  `⟪L f, L f⟫_ν ≤ (1 - γ)⟪f, f⟫_μ` for every mean-zero `f`.  Centering is handled
  once and for all here, by `Var_sub_const` and `dirichlet_self_sub_const`.
* `Adjoint.spectralGapAtLeast_comp_swap` — **the headline**: for `γ ≤ 1`, a gap
  of `γ` for `K ∘ₖ L` on `α` transfers to `L ∘ₖ K` on `β`.
* `Adjoint.spectralGapAtLeast_comp_iff` — the resulting equivalence, and
  `Adjoint.spectralGapAtLeast_comp_swap_min` the sharpest unconditional form.
* `upDown_spectralGapAtLeast_iff` — `lem:updown-downup` itself, obtained from
  `Levels.up_down_adjoint` in one line.

## The hypothesis `γ ≤ 1` is not decoration

The equivalence is **false** without it, and the failure is not an artefact of
the proof.  `SpectralGapAtLeast` is a Poincaré inequality, so it is vacuously
true for *every* `γ` when every function on `α` has zero variance, while the
composite on the other side can be a genuine chain with gap exactly `1`.
`exists_adjoint_gap_not_swap` exhibits this for an arbitrary pair of spaces: take
`μ` a point mass, `K` the independent sampler onto `ν`, and `L` the constant
kernel back to that point.  Since `γ ≤ 1` is automatic for any composite with a
non-degenerate stationary measure (`gap_le_one_of_var_pos`, and every composite
here is positive semidefinite for free), the hypothesis costs nothing in
practice — but it must be stated.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`, and with no
eigenvalue, spectrum or spectral theorem anywhere.

/-! ## A Poincaré constant is at most `1` unless the chain is degenerate

Recorded first because it is what makes the hypothesis `γ ≤ 1` below harmless:
for a positive semidefinite chain the Dirichlet form is bounded above by the
variance, so no `γ > 1` can satisfy the Poincaré inequality unless *every*
function has zero variance. -/

`SpectralGapAtLeast μ (K ∘ₖ L) γ` is equivalent to the statement that `L`

as the squared inequality `⟪L f, L f⟫_ν ≤ (1 - γ)⟪f, f⟫_μ`, so that no square root
ever has to be introduced.

Both directions are needed downstream, and both are elementary: `→` is
`Adjoint.dirichlet_comp` on a mean-zero function, where `Var` *is* `⟪f,f⟫`, and
`←` is the same computation after centering, using that `Var` and the Dirichlet
form are alike insensitive to adding a constant. -/

Write `u = K g` for a mean-zero `g : β → ℝ`; `u` is mean-zero by
`Adjoint.Ex_act_left`.  Adjointness turns `⟪u, u⟫_μ` into `⟪g, L u⟫_ν`, Cauchy–
Schwarz (`ip_sq_le`) bounds its square by `⟪g,g⟫_ν ⟪L u, L u⟫_ν`, and the
hypothesis in norm form bounds `⟪L u, L u⟫_ν` by `(1-γ)⟪u,u⟫_μ`.  The result is
`⟪u,u⟫² ≤ (1-γ)⟪g,g⟫⟪u,u⟫`, which divides through.  Everything stays squared;

/-! ## Sharpness: the hypothesis `γ ≤ 1` cannot be dropped

The transfer above is *not* an unconditional equivalence, and the counterexample
is as simple as it could be.  A Poincaré inequality says nothing at all when
every function has zero variance, so a point mass on `α` satisfies
`SpectralGapAtLeast μ (K ∘ₖ L) γ` for every real `γ`, however large — while the
companion composite on `β` may be a perfectly ordinary chain whose gap is exactly
`1`.  Nothing here is special to a particular state space: the construction takes
any `ν` on any `β` and any point `a : α`. -/

/-- **The transfer fails for `γ > 1`.**

For any point `a : α`, any `ν` on `β` admitting a function of positive variance,
and any `γ > 1`, there is a mutually adjoint pair `K`, `L` such that `K ∘ₖ L` has
spectral gap at least `γ` while `L ∘ₖ K` does not.

The witness: `μ = δ_a`, `K x y = ν y` (jump to equilibrium), `L y x = [x = a]`
(jump back to `a`).  Then `L ∘ₖ K` is the independent sampler on `ν`, whose
Dirichlet form *is* the variance, so its Poincaré constant is exactly `1`; and
`K ∘ₖ L` lives over a distribution on which every variance vanishes, so it
satisfies every Poincaré inequality vacuously. -/
