# The converse: a Poincaré inequality for the local walk gives spectral independence

`Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence` proves `lem:QandPsi` — spectral
independence of the conditional measure gives the local walk `Q_η` a Poincaré
inequality — and it does so through the **exact identity**

`ℰ_{Q_η}(f) = m/(m−1) · Var_{π_{η,1}}(f) − quadForm (Cov μ_η) f̃ / (m(m−1))`,

`m = n − |Λ|` the number of free sites, `f̃ = freeRestrict Λ f`
(`dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`).  Because it is an identity and not an inequality,
reading it in the other direction costs nothing: a *lower* bound on `ℰ_{Q_η}`
is an *upper* bound on `quadForm (Cov μ_η)`, which is exactly the semidefinite
ordering `Cov ⪯ η · diag (marg)` that `Techniques.SpectralIndependence` takes as
the definition of spectral independence.  This module is that reading, and the
constants come out as exact inverses of each other:

* forward   `SpectralIndependence μ_η η` ⟹ gap `(m − η)/(m − 1)`;
* converse  gap `γ`                      ⟹ `SpectralIndependence μ_η (m − γ(m−1))`,

and `m − ((m − η)/(m − 1))·(m − 1) = η` on the nose, so the two compose to the
identity in both directions.  That equivalence is
`spectralIndependence_iff_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`, the headline here.

## What is proved *here*, and a correction to the obvious paraphrase

The monograph's converse — [CSV23, `lem:opt-relax-SI`], i.e. Zongchen Chen,
Daniel Štefankovič, Eric Vigoda, *Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global
Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains*, arXiv:2307.13826 (2023), which
quotes it from Anari–Jain–Koehler–Pham–Vuong (which of their papers is meant is
not recorded anywhere in this library) — reads:

> if for any pinning `τ` on a subset `S` of vertices, **the Glauber dynamics**
> for `μ_τ` has relaxation time bounded by `≤ C·(n−|S|)`, then `μ` is
> `(C−1)`-spectrally independent.

The chain there is the *Glauber dynamics*, not the local walk `Q_τ`, and the
factor `n − |S|` is the Glauber slowdown (one site is resampled per step), which
the local walk does not have.  So `lem:opt-relax-SI` is **not** what this module
proves.  What is proved here is the local-walk converse: the exact inverse of
`spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`, and the sharper statement per pinning.  The
shape of the constant does match: the monograph's `η` is our `η − 1`
(`Techniques.SpectralIndependence`), so its `(C−1)`-spectral independence is our
`C`-spectral independence, and `C` there plays the role of `m − γ(m−1)` here.

`lem:opt-relax-SI` itself is proved in `Chains.GlauberToSpectralIndependence`,
and by a route that needs no converse Random Walk Theorem: it never mentions the
local walk, but tests the Glauber Poincaré inequality at the *linear statistics*
`σ ↦ ∑_v a (v, σ v)`, where the left-hand side is the covariance form on the nose
(`quadForm_Cov`) and the right-hand side is
`(1/n)∑_v μ[Var_v]` (`dirichlet_glauber`).  That is
`spectralIndependence_pinned_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`, with the pinned
chain built honestly as `freeGlauber` — the mixture over the *free* sites, not
`glauber (pinWeight …)`, which carries holding probability `|Λ|/|V|`.  Composing
it with `spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk` gives the missing step in the form this
module could not supply,
`spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`, and composing
further with `Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing` closes the round trip
(`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_optimalRelaxationTime`).

## Which quantifier moves

The quantifiers do **not** have to move together: one pinning's gap gives that
pinning's spectral independence.  The reason is `Cov_eq_zero_of_marg_eq_one` —
a site whose spin is already determined contributes a row of zeros to the
covariance form — so for a *pinned* measure `quadForm (Cov μ_τ)` cannot see the
pinned coordinates at all, and the test vectors `f̃` reachable from functions on
the free pairs already exhaust the form.  For an arbitrary weight `w` carrying a
free set `Λ` (the generality in which `pinDist` and `pinLocalWalk` are stated)
that is false, and the conclusion degrades to the restricted ordering
`quadForm (Cov μ) (freeRestrict Λ a) ≤ η ∑_p marg p · (freeRestrict Λ a p)²`.
That restricted form is
`quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_le_marg_of_spectralGapAtLeast`, and being a pinned
weight is the only extra hypothesis anything here needs.

Two further notes on what the converse needs that the forward direction did not.

*No centering.*  The forward direction had to evaluate spectral independence at
a site shift of `f̃`, because it needed to turn a second moment into a variance
(`quadForm_Cov_add_site`).  Going the other way the inequality points the
friendly way — `m·Var_π(f) ≤ ∑_p marg p · f̃ p²` with the deficit
`(∑_p marg p · f̃ p)²/m` thrown away — and no shift is used anywhere below.  The
slack is recorded exactly in `numFree_mul_Var_pinDist`, and it costs nothing:
the round trip is still an equivalence.

*Non-degeneracy is free.*  The constant `m − γ(m−1)` must be nonnegative for the
last step (a second moment dominates `m·Var`, so the constant multiplying it
must not be negative).  This is not a hypothesis: `π_{η,1}` spreads over at
least two free sites, so the indicator of one free site has positive variance
(`Var_pinDist_siteIndicator`), and the identity together with `psd_Cov` then
forces `γ ≤ m/(m−1)` (`numFree_sub_mul_nonneg`).

* `numFree_mul_Var_pinDist`, `numFree_mul_Var_pinDist_le` — `m·Var_π(f)` against
  the second moment of `f̃`, exactly and then as an inequality.
* **`quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_le_of_spectralGapAtLeast`** — the identity,
  rearranged: a gap `γ` bounds `quadForm (Cov μ) f̃` by `(m − γ(m−1))·m·Var_π(f)`.
* `exists_not_mem_of_card_succ_lt`, `freeRestrict_siteIndicator`,
  `sum_marg_siteIndicator`, `Var_pinDist_siteIndicator`,
  **`numFree_sub_mul_nonneg`** — the non-degeneracy of `π_{η,1}` and hence
  `0 ≤ m − γ(m−1)`.
* `marg_eq_zero_of_marg_eq_one`, **`Cov_eq_zero_of_marg_eq_one`** — a
  deterministic site is invisible to the covariance form.
* `quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_eq`, `marg_gibbsPin_eq_one`,
  `exists_marg_gibbsPin_eq_one` — hence for a pinned measure the covariance form
  only sees the free pairs.
* **`quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_le_marg_of_spectralGapAtLeast`** and
  `sum_marg_freeRestrict_sq_le` — the restricted ordering, in the second-moment
  shape that `SpectralIndependence` is stated against.
* **`spectralIndependence_of_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`** — the converse
  at a pinning, with constant `m − γ(m−1)`.
* **`spectralIndependence_iff_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`** — the two
  directions as a single equivalence, with no loss in either constant.
* `spectralIndependence_of_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_empty` and
  `spectralIndependence_iff_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_empty` — the
  unpinned case, where no zero-row argument is needed because
  `freeRestrict ∅ = id`, and which therefore holds for an arbitrary weight.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`, and no
eigenvalue, spectrum or Hermitian matrix appears anywhere.

`ip_pinDist_self` and `Ex_pinDist` express the two moments of `π_{η,1}` as sums
against `marg`, divided by `m`.  Combining them gives `m·Var_π(f)` as a second
moment minus a nonnegative deficit; throwing the deficit away is the only slack
in this module, and the round trip below shows it costs nothing. -/

/-! ## The identity, rearranged

This is the whole mathematical content of the module.  `dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`
is an equation between `ℰ_{Q_η}(f)`, `Var_{π_{η,1}}(f)` and
`quadForm (Cov μ) f̃`; solving it for the covariance term turns a Poincaré
inequality into a bound on the covariance form. -/

section Rearrange

variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] {S : Type*} [Fintype S] [DecidableEq S]

/-- **The rearranged identity.**

If the local walk `Q_η` has Poincaré constant `γ` with respect to `π_{η,1}`,
then for every `f`

`quadForm (Cov μ) (freeRestrict Λ f) ≤ (m − γ(m−1)) · (m · Var_{π_{η,1}}(f))`,

with `m = n − |Λ|`.  This is `dirichlet_pinLocalWalk` solved for the covariance
term and nothing else; the hypothesis is used only at the single `f` in
question, so the statement is really a pointwise rearrangement of the identity.

Note that this holds for an *arbitrary* nonnegative weight `w`: the set `Λ`
enters only through the counting of free sites.  Upgrading the conclusion from
the restricted vectors `freeRestrict Λ f` to all vectors is where `w` has to be
a pinned weight; see `quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_eq`. -/

/-! ## `π_{η,1}` is not a point mass

The last step of the converse multiplies a second moment by the constant
`m − γ(m−1)`, so that constant must be nonnegative.  It is, and no hypothesis is
needed: `π_{η,1}` charges at least two free sites, so the indicator of one free
site is a function of positive variance, and the identity plus `psd_Cov` then
caps `γ` at `m/(m−1)`. -/

/-! ## The converse

The three pieces assemble.  For an arbitrary weight the conclusion is the
restricted ordering; for a pinned weight the restriction is vacuous and the
conclusion is spectral independence on the nose. -/

/-- **The restricted ordering.**

For an arbitrary nonnegative weight `w` with free set `Λ`, a Poincaré constant
`γ` for `Q_η` bounds the covariance form on the vectors supported on the free
pairs:

`quadForm (Cov μ) (freeRestrict Λ a) ≤ (m − γ(m−1)) · ∑_p marg p · (freeRestrict Λ a p)²`.

This is spectral independence *restricted to the free coordinates*, and it is
all that the identity gives without knowing that `w` is a pinned weight. -/

/-- **The converse of `lem:QandPsi`, at a pinning.**

If the local walk `Q_τ` at the pinning `τ` on `Λ` has Poincaré constant `γ` with
respect to `π_{τ,1}`, then the conditional Gibbs measure `μ_τ` is
`(m − γ(m−1))`-spectrally independent, `m = n − |Λ|`.

Everything is the rearranged identity: `dirichlet_pinLocalWalk` turns the
Poincaré inequality into an upper bound on `quadForm (Cov μ_τ) f̃`,
`numFree_mul_Var_pinDist_le` replaces `m·Var_π` by the second moment that
spectral independence is stated against, and `quadForm_Cov_freeRestrict_eq`
removes the restriction to free pairs — the pinned sites are deterministic, so
the covariance form never saw them.  No centering and no site shift is used, in
contrast with the forward direction.

The constant is the exact inverse of the forward one; see
`spectralIndependence_iff_spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk`. -/

/-- **Spectral independence and the local-walk Poincaré inequality are
equivalent, with no loss in either constant.**

`μ_τ` is `η`-spectrally independent **iff** the local walk `Q_τ` has Poincaré
constant `(m − η)/(m − 1)`, where `m = n − |Λ|` is the number of free sites.

The forward direction is `spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_pinned`
(`Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence`); the backward direction is the theorem
above, whose constant `m − γ(m−1)` evaluates at `γ = (m − η)/(m − 1)` to exactly
`η`.  Both directions are consequences of the *same* identity
`dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`, which is why nothing is lost: an identity read from
left to right and from right to left.

In the monograph's normalisation (our `η` is its `1 + η`) the right-hand side is
`γ(Q_τ) ≥ 1 − η_monograph/(n − |Λ| − 1)`, so this says that bound is not merely
sufficient but *characteristic* of spectral independence at that pinning. -/

/-! ### The unpinned case

At `Λ = ∅` the restriction `freeRestrict ∅` is the identity, so the zero-row
argument is not needed and the converse holds for an *arbitrary* nonnegative
weight, not only for a pinned one. -/

/-- **The converse at the empty pinning, for an arbitrary weight.**

A Poincaré constant `γ` for the unpinned local walk makes `gibbs w` spectrally
independent with constant `n − γ(n−1)`.  Unlike the pinned statement this needs
no hypothesis on `w` at all: `freeRestrict ∅` is the identity, so the restricted
ordering *is* the ordering. -/
