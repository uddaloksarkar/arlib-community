# Collecting `h` samples from a failing oracle: rejection sampling, exactly

An algorithm that needs `h` independent samples from a distribution `ν`, but only
has an oracle that *fails* with some probability and, when it does not fail,
returns a `ν`-distributed sample, does the obvious thing: it calls the oracle
`c` times, discards the failures, and keeps the successes, stopping early once
`h` have been collected.  This module proves the two facts that such an algorithm
needs, for the loop written exactly as algorithms write it.

## What is proved

Write `d : PMF (Option Ω)` for the oracle's output law, `s` for its success
probability and `ν` for its conditional law given success, i.e.

    d (some x) = s * ν x            (`hs` below)

and `collectLaw d h c acc` for "call `d` at most `c` more times, appending each
success to `acc`, stopping as soon as `h` samples are in hand".

**1. The conditioning half (`collectLaw_toOuterMeasure`).**  For every event `A`
of the collected list,

    Pr[ collect returns a full list  ∧  that list ∈ A ]
      = binTail (d none) s c (h - |acc|) · Pr_{l ~ iidList ν (h - |acc|)}[ acc ++ l ∈ A ]

an *exact identity*, with no hypothesis beyond `hs`.  Its two halves are the two
statements one wants:

* taking `A = univ` (`collectLaw_full`) identifies the success probability of the
  loop as `binTail (d none) s c (h - |acc|)`, the probability that `c` Bernoulli
  trials of success probability `s` produce at least `h - |acc|` successes;
* dividing, the *conditional* law of the retained samples given success is
  exactly `iidList ν (h - |acc|)`: **discarding failures does not bias the
  survivors, and does not correlate them**.  Early stopping — the `if h ≤ |acc|`
  guard, which makes the number of oracle calls a random variable depending on
  the samples already drawn — does not bias them either.

The identity is proved by induction on the call budget `c`; the induction is
where the conditioning happens, and it needs no independence hypothesis, because
"a fresh call to the same oracle" *is* `PMF.bind`.

**2. The tail half (`one_sub_exp_le_binTail`).**  `binTail (1-s) s c e` is
literally the upper tail of a sum of `c` i.i.d. Bernoulli(`s`) variables
(`binTail_eq_outProb_repeatPMF`), so `Arlib.Approximation.outProbR_lower_tail` —
Hoeffding at the sharp constant, already proved in
`Arlib.Approximation.Hoeffding` — gives

    (e : ℝ) / c ≤ s - t   →   1 - exp(-2ct²) ≤ binTail (1-s) s c e.

Nothing here is re-derived: the Chernoff/Hoeffding content is imported from
`Hoeffding.lean` and only the identification of `binTail` with a `repeatPMF`
event is new.

**3. The two together (`le_outProbR_collectSamples`).**  For the cost-carrying
loop `collectSamples` that algorithms actually run, if `h/c ≤ s - t` then

    Pr_{iidList ν h}[A] - exp(-2ct²)  ≤  Pr[ collect full ∧ ∈ A ].

This is the shape a caller wants: *analyse the algorithm as if it drew `h`
exact i.i.d. samples, and pay `exp(-2ct²)` once.*

## What is **not** proved, and is not true

The budget `c` must satisfy `h/c ≤ s - t` with `t > 0`, i.e. `c > h/s`.  There is
no version of `one_sub_exp_le_binTail` for `c ≤ h/s`: at `c` calls the expected
number of successes is `cs`, and if `cs < h` then `Pr[≥ h successes]` is
exponentially *small*, not large.  Callers whose oracle needs `k` primitive calls
per retained sample must use the success probability of the *composite* draw,
which is the `k`-th power of the primitive one, not the primitive one.

## Main definitions

* `collectSamples` — the loop as algorithms write it, carrying a cost counter.
* `collectLaw` — the same loop with the cost erased; `map_fst_collectSamples`
  says the two agree.
* `iidList` — `k` independent draws from `ν`, as a list.
* `binTail q s c e` — `Pr[at least `e` successes in `c` trials]`, by its
  Pascal recursion.

## Main results

* `collectLaw_toOuterMeasure` — the exact factorisation.  Fully proved.
* `collectLaw_full`, `condLaw_collectLaw` — success probability and conditional
  law.  Fully proved.
* `binTail_eq_outProb_repeatPMF`, `one_sub_exp_le_binTail` — the tail.  Fully
  proved, from `Arlib.Approximation.outProbR_lower_tail`.
* `outProb_collectSamples_eq`, `le_outProbR_collectSamples` — the packaged form.
  Fully proved.

Note that the number of calls actually made is a random variable: the loop stops
when `h ≤ acc.length`, an event determined by the draws so far. -/

no truncated subtraction ever appears. -/

/-! ## The conditioning theorem -/

/-- **Discarding failures preserves the law of the survivors.**

`d` is the oracle's output law, `s` its success probability and `ν` its
conditional law given success, packaged as `d (some x) = s * ν x` — the form in
which such a guarantee is normally available, and the form
`Arlib.Approximation.PreprocessedSampler.uniform` delivers.

The conclusion is an exact identity: the probability that the loop returns a
*full* list lying in `A` factors as

    (probability of at least `h - |acc|` successes in `c` trials)
      × (probability that `acc` followed by `h - |acc|` exact i.i.d. `ν`-draws lies in `A`).

Two things are being asserted at once, and the second is the point: the retained
samples are, conditionally on the loop having succeeded, **exactly** `h - |acc|`
i.i.d. draws from `ν` — not merely unbiased, and not merely pairwise
independent.  Rejection introduces no bias and early stopping introduces no
correlation.

The proof is an induction on the call budget `c`.  In the inductive step the
oracle's output is either `none`, which leaves `acc` alone and consumes a call,
or `some x`, which appends `x` and consumes a call; `tsum_option` splits the
`bind` into exactly those two terms, the inductive hypothesis rewrites each, and
what is left is Pascal's recursion for `binTail` together with
`iidList_succ_toOuterMeasure` for the `ν`-side.  No independence is assumed
anywhere: successive calls are successive `PMF.bind`s. -/

If the call budget `c` is generous enough that the target count `h` sits a margin
`t` below the expected number of successes `c·s`, then the algorithm's loop —
which draws at most `h` samples in `c` calls to a failing oracle, discarding
failures — puts at least

    Pr_{h exact i.i.d. ν-draws}[A]  −  exp(−2ct²)

of its mass on "a full list, lying in `A`".  In other words: *analyse the
algorithm as if it drew `h` exact i.i.d. samples, and pay `exp(−2ct²)` once.*

The two ingredients are `outProb_collectSamples_eq` (no bias, no correlation) and
`one_sub_exp_le_binTail` (enough calls). -/
