# Parsimonious reductions transport FPRAS and FPAUS

A **parsimonious reduction** from a counting problem `f : α → ℝ` to a counting
problem `g : β → ℝ` is a polynomial-time map `h : α → β` with `f w = g (h w)`
for every instance `w`: it does not merely preserve *whether* there is a
solution, it preserves *how many* there are, on the nose.

The folklore fact this module proves is that such a reduction transports
approximation: if `g` has an FPRAS then so does `f`, and — when the reduction is
witnessed by a bijection on solution *sets*, not just an equality of counts — if
`g` has an FPAUS then so does `f`.  Sources state these without proof; here they
are proved.

## Design decisions

**The reduction's cost is a parameter, not a proof obligation.**  `h` comes with
a function `hcost : α → ℕ` and a hypothesis `PolyBounded sizeA hcost`.  There is
no model of computation in `Arlib.Approximation.Counting`, so "polynomial-time
computable" cannot be a property of `h` alone; it has to be supplied.  A caller
who has a concrete `h` discharges the hypothesis by exhibiting a bound.

**A size blow-up hypothesis is genuinely needed and is separate.**  The target
algorithm's running time is polynomial in the size of *its own* input `h w`, and
`sizeB (h w)` bears no relation to `sizeA w` unless one is assumed.  Folding it
into `hcost` would be wrong: a reduction may run in linear time and still be
required to state how big its output is.

**The transfer is lossless in the approximation parameters.**  Neither theorem
rescales `ε` or `δ`, and neither degrades the `3/4` confidence.  That is the
whole point of *parsimonious*: the composed algorithm inherits the guarantee
verbatim, and the only thing that changes is the running time.  Concretely, both
accuracy proofs are a single rewrite (`outProbR_map_addCost`, resp.
`decodeOpt_preimage_some`) followed by the source hypothesis.

**The polynomial arithmetic is elementary and shared.**  `poly_comp_add` is
stated over `ℕ` with explicit constants and proved from `Nat.pow_le_pow_left`
and `Nat.pow_le_pow_right`; no asymptotics, no `Filter.Tendsto`, no
`Polynomial`.  Because the second size parameter (`⌈ε⁻¹⌉₊` for FPRAS,
`⌈log(1/δ)⌉₊` for FPAUS) is passed through the reduction *unchanged*, the same
lemma serves both theorems even though the two definitions treat their tolerance
parameters differently.

**Sampling needs a bijection, counting does not.**  `IsFPRAS.comp_parsimonious`
asks only for `f w = g (h w)`; `IsFPAUS.comp_bijection` asks for a family of
bijections `↥(g₁ w) ≃ ↥(g₂ (h w))`.  The asymmetry is forced: a sampler must
hand back a solution of the *original* instance, and an equality of counts
provides no way to produce one.

## Main results

* `poly_comp`, `poly_add`, `poly_comp_add` — composition of polynomial bounds.
* `decodeOpt` — the total decoder induced by a bijection of solution sets, and
  `decodeOpt_preimage_some`, the event identity it satisfies.
* `IsFPRAS.comp_parsimonious` — an FPRAS transfers along a parsimonious
  reduction.
* `IsFPAUS.comp_bijection` — an FPAUS transfers along a bijective reduction.
* `ParsimoniousReduction` — the two hypotheses bundled, with
  `.isFPRAS_comp` and `.isFPAUS_comp`.

/-! ## Composing polynomial bounds

Everything the transfer theorems need about "polynomial time" is the arithmetic
fact that substituting a polynomial into a polynomial and adding a polynomial
stays polynomial.  It is proved here for `ℕ` by hand, in the exact shape the
`polytime` clauses present it, rather than through an asymptotics library: the
statements below are inequalities between concrete expressions with explicit
constants, so they compose by `le_trans` and nothing has to be transported
across a filter. -/

/-- **A polynomial of a polynomial is a polynomial.**

The outer bound `c * (· + m + 1) ^ d` is applied to a quantity already bounded by
`c' * (n + 1) ^ d'`; the result is bounded by a single polynomial in `n + m`.

The exponent is `max d' 1 * d` rather than `d' * d` because the summand `m + 1`
must also be absorbed into `(n + m + 1) ^ (max d' 1)`, and that needs the
exponent to be at least `1`; at `d' = 0` the naive `d' * d = 0` is simply false. -/

/-! ## Transporting an FPRAS -/

/-- **A parsimonious reduction transports an FPRAS.**

Given `h : α → β` computable in time `hcost`, polynomially bounded in the size of
its input, whose image does not blow the instance size up by more than a
polynomial, and which is *parsimonious* — `f w = g (h w)` — an FPRAS `B` for `g`
becomes an FPRAS for `f`: run `B` on `h w` and charge `hcost w` extra steps.

The accuracy clause is inherited *verbatim*.  This is the whole content of
"parsimonious": because `f w = g (h w)` is an equality of reals, the event
`|y - f w| ≤ ε * f w` is literally the event `|y - g (h w)| ≤ ε * g (h w)`, and
post-composing with a cost adjustment leaves the output law alone
(`outProbR_map_addCost`).  Nothing about the accuracy is degraded — no union
bound, no rescaling of `ε`, no loss in the confidence `3/4`.

The polytime clause is where the work is, and it is entirely the arithmetic of
`poly_comp_add`. -/

/-! ## Decoding a sample back along a bijection

To transport a *sampler* a bare equality of counts is not enough: one must be
able to turn a solution of the target instance into a solution of the source
instance.  The datum is a bijection `e : ↥s₁ ≃ ↥s₂` between the two solution
sets, and `decodeOpt` is the total function on `Option`s it induces. -/

/-- The decoder induced by a bijection `e : ↥s₁ ≃ ↥s₂` between two solution sets.

It is *total*: a target value outside `s₂` — which the sampler never produces —
is mapped to `none`, and so is `none` itself.  Making it total rather than
partial is what keeps the composed algorithm a plain `PMF.map`, and the `none`
default costs nothing because the two events that matter (`{some x}` for a real
solution, and `{none}` on an empty instance) are unaffected by it. -/

/-! ## Transporting an FPAUS -/

/-- **A bijective (hence parsimonious) reduction transports an FPAUS.**

The datum is stronger than for `IsFPRAS.comp_parsimonious`, and has to be: a
sampler must *return a solution of the original instance*, so an equality of
counts is not enough — one needs a family of bijections
`e w : ↥(g₁ w) ≃ ↥(g₂ (h w))` whose inverse decodes an answer.  (In the
application `e w` reads an answer tuple off an accepted tree.)  The composed
algorithm runs `B` on `h w`, decodes with `e w`, and charges `cost w` extra
steps, where `cost` covers both computing `h` and decoding.

All three clauses transfer without loss:

* `uniform`, because `decodeOpt_preimage_some` makes "the decoded output is `x`"
  the *same event* as "the raw output is `e x`", and `card_eq_of_equiv` makes the
  two uniform windows the same interval.  The tolerance `δ` is not degraded.
* `empty`, because a bijection between solution sets makes `g₁ w` empty exactly
  when `g₂ (h w)` is, and then the decoder maps everything to `none`.
* `polytime`, by `poly_comp_add` again — and note this is where the `log(1/δ)`
  convention pays for itself: the second size parameter is passed through
  unchanged, so the very same arithmetic serves both transfer theorems. -/

the two polynomial bounds (on that cost and on the size blow-up), the
parsimony equation `f w = g (toFun w)`, and the family of decoding bijections.

`count_eq` and `decode` overlap — a bijection already forces the *cardinalities*
to agree (`ParsimoniousReduction.card_eq`) — but they are kept separate because
`f` and `g` need not be the cardinality functions: a counting problem is often
presented by a formula whose value is proved equal to a count only later.  When
they *are* cardinalities, `count_eq` follows and `card_eq` is the proof. -/
