# The Karp–Luby union-of-sets estimator

Given finite sets `A 0, …, A (ℓ-1)` in a common universe, with known sizes, a
uniform sampler for each and a membership test for each, Karp and Luby — [KLM89]:
Richard M. Karp, Michael Luby, Neal Madras, *Monte-Carlo approximation algorithms
for enumeration problems*, J. Algorithms **10**(3):429–448, 1989, preliminary
version Karp–Luby, FOCS 1983 — estimate
`|⋃_j A j|` by sampling a pair `(j, x)` with `j` proportional to `|A j|` and
`x` uniform in `A j`, and accepting iff `j` is the *least* index with `x ∈ A j`.

This module proves the estimator, in four layers.

## 1. The exact identity

The whole combinatorial content is that the map `x ↦ (least j with x ∈ A j, x)`
is a bijection from `⋃_j A j` onto `{(j, x) : x ∈ A j ∧ ∀ j' < j, x ∉ A j'}`.
Write `firstHits A j` for the `j`-th fibre of the target.  Then:

* `existsUnique_mem_firstHits` — every element of the union lies in exactly one
  `firstHits A j`.  This *is* the bijection.
* `card_unionAll` — `|⋃_j A j| = Σ_j |firstHits A j|`.
* `card_sigma_firstHits` — the same statement as an equality of cardinalities of
  the two sides of the bijection, proved by exhibiting it.
* `card_unionAll_eq_sum_mul_hitProb` — the probabilistic form the sources state,
  `|⋃_j A j| = Σ_j |A j| · p_j` with `p_j = Pr_{x ∼ Unif(A j)}[∀ j' < j, x ∉ A j']`.

All of this is finite combinatorics and is proved outright.

## 2. The `1/ℓ` lower bound

`totalCard A = Σ_j |A j| ≤ ℓ · |⋃_j A j|`, because each `A j` embeds in the
union.  Hence the acceptance probability `acceptProb A = |⋃_j A j| / Σ_j |A j|`
is at least `1/ℓ` (`inv_card_le_acceptProb`).  This is the only place `ℓ` enters,
and it is what fixes the sample count at `Θ(ℓ² log(1/δ)/ε²)`; see the note on the
index count below.

## 3. The estimator and its error bound

`trialPMF A` is one Karp–Luby trial: draw `(j, x)` uniformly from the disjoint
union `Σ_j A j` — which is exactly "`j` with probability `|A j| / Σ|A|`, then `x`
uniform in `A j`" — and output `1` on acceptance, `0` otherwise.  Its acceptance
probability is *exactly* `acceptProb A` (`outProbR_trialAlg_one`), and the proof
is one application of the bijection of layer 1.

`estimateAlg A μ h` runs `h` independent trials (using `repeatPMF` of
`Arlib.Approximation.Amplification`, so independence is how the term is written,
not a side condition) and returns `Σ_j |A j|` times the empirical acceptance
rate.  `estimateAlg_accuracy` says that with
`h = sampleCount ℓ ε δ = ⌈ℓ² log(2/δ) / (2ε²)⌉₊` samples the answer is within a
multiplicative `(1 ± ε)` of `|⋃_j A j|` with probability `1 - δ`.

`isFPRAS_unionAlg` packages this as an `IsFPRAS`.

## 4. What is imported

Exactly one thing: **Hoeffding's inequality for `h` independent `{0,1}`-valued
runs**, as the hypothesis bundle `HoeffdingBound`.  `Arlib.Approximation.Concentration`
proves the *one-sided, fixed-threshold* bound needed for median amplification
(`MajorityConcentration`) directly on the `repeatPMF` tower; the two-sided
deviation bound `Pr[|p̃ - p| > t] ≤ 2 exp(-2ht²)` needed here has the same shape
but needs Hoeffding's lemma for the sharp constant, which is a development in its
own right.  Following the house style of `Arlib.Approximation.Amplification`,
**imported results are hypotheses, never axioms**: every theorem that uses it
carries it in its statement, and `#print axioms` still returns only Mathlib's
three.

**And it is now discharged.**  `Arlib.Approximation.Hoeffding` proves
`hoeffdingBound : HoeffdingBound` at exactly this constant, so `estimateAlg_accuracy`,
`isFPRAS_unionAlg` and `isFPRAS_union_of_isUnion` become unconditional once it is
supplied, with `sampleCount` unchanged.  That module imports this one, so this
module stays independent of it and the bundle remains a parameter here; pass
`hoeffdingBound` at any call site.

Note the bundle is stated for a `{0,1}`-valued `PMF (ℝ × ℕ)` and the `repeatPMF`
of `Amplification`, i.e. in exactly the vocabulary `Concentration` already works
in.

## A note on the index count `ℓ`

The `ℓ` in `sampleCount` is the number of sets in the family, and it enters
*squared*.  In the intended application — [ACJR21, `prop:prop1`]: Marcelo Arenas,
Luis Alberto Croquevielle, Rajesh Jayaram, Cristian Riveros, *#NFA admits an
FPRAS*, J. ACM **68**(6), art. 48, 2021 (arXiv:1906.09226), cited by the labels
of the authors' manuscript, which is not distributed with this library — the
family is the set of transitions out of a state in the saturated transition relation
`Δ̄`, and the source repeatedly bounds that count by `m`; the correct bound is
`n·m`, since each `Δ`-transition spawns `i - 2 ≤ n` of them.  Nothing here
depends on which bound is right — `ℓ` is a parameter and `inv_card_le_acceptProb`
is stated for it — but a reader transcribing `h = O(log(4m/δ)·m²/ε²)` from the
source will get a sample count that is too small by a factor `n²`, and a union
bound over `j ∈ [ℓ]` at per-`j` confidence `δ/(2m)` that does not close.  The
honest form is `h = O(log(nm/δ)·(nm)²/ε²)`.

## Main definitions

* `unionAll`, `firstHits` — the union and its first-occurrence decomposition.
* `hitProb`, `acceptProb` — the per-set and overall acceptance probabilities.
* `uniformOn` — the uniform `PMF` on a nonempty `Finset`.
* `trialPMF`, `trialAlg` — one Karp–Luby trial.
* `estimateAlg`, `sampleCount`, `unionAlg` — the estimator.
* `HoeffdingBound` — the imported concentration inequality, as a bundle.

## Main results

* `existsUnique_mem_firstHits`, `card_unionAll`, `card_sigma_firstHits`,
  `card_unionAll_eq_sum_mul_hitProb` — the exact identity.  Fully proved.
* `totalCard_le_mul_card_unionAll`, `inv_card_le_acceptProb` — the `1/ℓ` bound.
  Fully proved.
* `outProbR_trialAlg_one` — a trial accepts with probability exactly
  `|⋃_j A j| / Σ_j |A j|`.  Fully proved.
* `estimateAlg_accuracy`, `isFPRAS_unionAlg` — the estimator's guarantee.
  Conditional on `HoeffdingBound`.
* `unionAll_eq_of_isUnion`, `isFPRAS_union_of_isUnion` — the same guarantee in
  the shape a consumer states it, for an abstract `U` given only
  `∀ w x, x ∈ U w ↔ ∃ i, x ∈ A w i`.

/-! ## The imported concentration bound

See the module docstring: this is the *only* unproved ingredient below. -/

/-- **I1 — Hoeffding's inequality for `h` independent `{0,1}`-valued runs.**

If a single run outputs `1` with probability `q` and otherwise `0`, then the mean
of `h` independent runs deviates from `q` by more than `t` with probability at
most `2 exp(-2 h t²)`.

**Not proved here — but proved.**  `Arlib.Approximation.Concentration` proves the
one-sided, fixed-threshold bound `MajorityConcentration` directly on the
`repeatPMF` tower by a Chernoff argument through `pexp_repeatPMF_pow`; the
two-sided *relative* deviation bound with the sharp constant `2` in the exponent
needs Hoeffding's lemma, which is a self-contained development with no bearing on
the union estimator.  That development is `Arlib.Approximation.Hoeffding`, and it
supplies `hoeffdingBound : HoeffdingBound` at this very constant.  So, in the
house style of `Arlib.Approximation.Amplification`, it is imported as a hypothesis
rather than assumed as an axiom, and every theorem below that uses it says so in
its statement; that module imports this one, so pass `hoeffdingBound` at the call
site and every such theorem becomes unconditional.

At `h = 0` the bound reads `-1 ≤ outProbR …`, which is vacuous, so the statement
is consistent at the degenerate end. -/

/-- **The estimator's error bound.**

If each trial accepts with probability exactly `acceptProb A` — the content of
`outProbR_trialAlg_one` — then `sampleCount ℓ ε δ` trials produce a
`(1 ± ε)`-approximation of `|⋃_j A j|` with probability at least `1 - δ`.

The argument has three steps and no slack:
* the deviation `t = ε/ℓ` is at most `ε · acceptProb A`, by
  `totalCard_div_le_card_unionAll` — this is where the `1/ℓ` bound is used;
* hence a mean within `t` of the truth rescales to an answer within `ε |⋃_j A j|`
  of `|⋃_j A j|`, because `|⋃_j A j| = Σ_j |A j| · acceptProb A`;
* and `sampleCount` is calibrated so that Hoeffding's failure probability at
  deviation `t` is at most `δ` (`two_mul_exp_sampleCount_le`).

Given a family of finite sets and a bound on the cost of one trial, `unionAlg`
is an FPRAS for `w ↦ |⋃_j A w j|`.  There is no nonemptiness hypothesis: on an
empty family the scheme returns `0`, which is the exact answer.

Accuracy is `estimateAlg_accuracy` at `δ = 1/4`, since an FPRAS's confidence is
the constant `3/4`; running time is `repeatPMF_cost_le` together with
`sampleCount_le`, so the scheme costs `O(ℓ² ε⁻²)` trials and the exponent grows

/-! ## The interface a consumer of the estimator states

`CQCount/Union/Fpras.lean` — in a sibling repository, not distributed with this
library — consumes Karp–Luby through a hypothesis bundle
`UnionEstimator size S U` whose fields are a membership-test cost, the union
hypothesis `∀ w x, x ∈ U w ↔ ∃ i, x ∈ S w i`, and two conclusions — an FPRAS and
an FPAUS for `U`.  The theorem below is the counting conclusion in exactly that
shape, so it applies to an abstract `U` given only the union hypothesis: the
bundle's `isUnion` field *is* `unionAll_eq_of_isUnion` here, and its `memCost` /
`memCost_poly` fields are subsumed by the single cost bound `hc`, which charges
one trial — index draw, uniform draw and the membership tests deciding
`x ∈ firstHits` — as a whole.

What is *not* supplied: the estimator built from per-set *approximate* counters
and *almost*-uniform samplers, and the sampling half.  Both are genuine further
work, not repackaging; see the report accompanying this module. -/
