# Hoeffding for `PMF` products: discharging `MajorityConcentration`

`Arlib.Approximation.Amplification` proves median amplification — confidence
`3/4` becomes `1 - δ` at a `Θ(log(1/δ))` multiplicative cost — conditional on one
named hypothesis bundle, `MajorityConcentration`: *if each of `m` independent
runs lands in `S` with probability at least `3/4`, a strict majority of them do,
except with probability `exp(-m/8)`.*  This module **proves that bundle**
(`majorityConcentration`), so every theorem in `Amplification` — in particular
`IsFPRAS.amplify` and `IsFPRAS.amplify_isFPRAS` — is now unconditional, with
nothing imported and no axioms beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound`.

## Why this is not a transport from `Arlib.Probability.Chernoff`

`Arlib.Probability.Chernoff` proves the multiplicative Chernoff bounds, but for
`Arlib.ProbSpace`/`FinProb` product spaces over a *finite* sample space, with the
count presented as `indicCount`.  A run here is a `PMF (ℝ × ℕ)`: the sample space
is uncountable and the `m`-fold product is the `PMF.bind` tower `repeatPMF`.  The
obvious bridge — push the product forward onto `Bool ^ m`, identify the count's
law with `PMF.binomial`, then match the binomial with a `FinProb` and quote a
Chernoff bound — is a long detour, and it does not even reach the target: the
*multiplicative* Chernoff lower tail at mean `3m/4` and threshold `m/2` gives
only `exp(-m/24)`, whereas `MajorityConcentration` fixes the sharp Hoeffding
constant `exp(-m/8)`.  Nothing weaker closes it.

So the argument here is run from first principles, directly on the `PMF` tower,
and it is short because it never leaves the monad.

## The argument

Write `N v = #{i | v i ∈ S}` for the good count and `p = P[X ∈ S] ≥ 3/4`.

1. **The moment generating function factors** (`pexp_repeatPMF_pow`).  For every
   `c : ℝ≥0∞`,
   `E_{repeatPMF μ m} [ c ^ N ] = (P[X ∉ S] + c · P[X ∈ S]) ^ m`.
   This is the only place independence is used, and it is used exactly as
   `repeatPMF` writes it: the proof is an induction along `repeatPMF`'s own
   recursion, with `pexp_bind` for the two `bind`s and `card_filter_cons` for the
   effect of `Fin.cons` on the count.  No product measure, no independence side
   condition, and — the point — **no binomial distribution**: the count's law is
   never named, only its generating function is, and that is all a Chernoff
   argument ever consumes.

2. **Markov at the Chernoff parameter `s = 1`** (`outProb_minority_le_mgf`).  A
   failed majority means `2N ≤ m`, hence `e^{m/2} · e^{-N} ≥ 1`, so the indicator
   of failure is dominated pointwise by `e^{m/2} · (e^{-1})^N`.  Taking
   expectations and applying step 1 at `c = e^{-1}` bounds the failure
   probability by `e^{m/2} · (P[X ∉ S] + e^{-1} p)^m`.

3. **The one-draw factor** (`mgf_step_le`).  `P[X ∉ S] + e^{-1} p` equals
   `e^{-1} + (1 - p)(1 - e^{-1})`, which is decreasing in `p`; at `p ≥ 3/4` it is
   at most `1/4 + (3/4)e^{-1}`.

4. **The constant** (`exp_half_mul_quarter_le`).  Everything now reduces to the
   single real inequality
   `e^{1/2} · (1/4 + (3/4)e^{-1}) ≤ e^{-1/8}`.
   Raising both sides to the eighth power clears every fractional exponent and
   leaves the polynomial inequality `(e + 3)^8 ≤ 65536 · e^3` in `e = exp 1`
   alone, which `2.718 < e < 2.719` settles with roughly `13%` of room.  Taking
   `m`-th powers (`exp_pow_bound`) turns this into `exp(-m/8)`.

The parameter `s = 1` is not arbitrary: it is exactly the value at which the
Chernoff exponent for a `3/4`-biased Bernoulli hits the Hoeffding constant
`2 · (1/4)² = 1/8`.  A different `s` would give a different — and, for the
statement of `MajorityConcentration`, a useless — constant.

## The supporting `PMF` expectation API

`pexp ν g = ∑' b, ν b * g b` is the expectation of an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued function
under a `PMF`.  Working in `ℝ≥0∞` rather than `ℝ` is deliberate: every
rearrangement below is a `tsum` manipulation, and in `ℝ≥0∞` those are
unconditional — there is no summability side goal anywhere, and
`ENNReal.tsum_comm` swaps the
two sums of `pexp_bind` for free.  Reality is restored once, at the very end, by
`ENNReal.ofReal`/`toReal`, where the quantities involved are already known to be
at most `1`.

`outProb_le_pexp` is Markov's inequality in the form the event algebra of
`Arlib.Approximation.Counting` wants (the event is read off the first coordinate,
the step count marginalised out), and `outProb_add_compl` is the complementation
identity that turns a bound on the failure probability into the `1 - exp(-m/8)`
lower bound the statement asks for.  Neither needs the sample space to be
measurable in any sense: a `PMF` is a `tsum`, and both are proved as such.

## Main results

* `pexp_repeatPMF_pow` — the moment generating function of the good count over
  an `m`-fold `PMF` product factors as an `m`-th power.  Reusable for any
  Chernoff-style bound on `repeatPMF`, at any parameter `c`.
* `exp_half_mul_quarter_le` — the numeric inequality that pins the constant `8`
  in `exp(-m/8)`, reduced to `(e + 3)^8 ≤ 65536 e^3`.
* `outProb_minority_le` — the Hoeffding bound itself, in `ℝ≥0∞`.
* `majorityConcentration` — `MajorityConcentration`, proved.  **Nothing in this
  file, or in `Amplification`, is imported or assumed any more.**

/-- **The one numeric inequality the whole bound rests on.**

At the Chernoff parameter `s = 1`, one draw contributes a factor
`e^{1/2} · (1/4 + (3/4)e^{-1})` to the tail bound, and the target `exp(-m/8)`
asks for that factor to be at most `e^{-1/8}`.  Raising both sides to the eighth
power clears every fractional exponent and turns the claim into the polynomial
inequality `(e + 3)^8 ≤ 65536 · e^3` in `e = exp 1` alone, which the rational
bounds `2.718 < e < 2.719` settle with about `13%` to spare.

This is exactly where the constant `8` in `exp(-m/8)` — and hence the
`m = ⌈8 log(1/δ)⌉₊` of `IsFPRAS.amplify` — is decided. -/
