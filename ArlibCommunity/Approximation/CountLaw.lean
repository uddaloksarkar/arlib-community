# Counting a predicate over a sample list is a sum of Bernoulli trials

An algorithm that draws `n` i.i.d. samples and reports the *fraction* satisfying
some predicate is written, in code, as a `List.countP` over a list of samples.
An algorithm that is *analysed* by Hoeffding is written as the empirical mean of
`n` independent `{0,1}`-valued trials, i.e. as a `sum` over
`Arlib.Approximation.repeatPMF`.  These are different terms of different types —
one is a `PMF (List Ω)` pushed along a `List → ℝ`, the other a
`PMF ((Fin n → ℝ) × ℕ)` pushed along a `(Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` — and the concentration
theory is stated only for the second.

This module proves that they have the same law.  Nothing here is probabilistic
beyond the two constructions' own recursions: it is `iidList` versus `repeatPMF`,
and it holds for every `ν`, every predicate and every `n`.

## What is proved

Write `countTrial ν p c` for the single trial "draw `x ∼ ν`, output `1` if `p x`
and `0` otherwise, at cost `c`".  Then (`map_countP_iidList`)

    (iidList ν n).map (fun l => (l.countP p : ℝ))
      = (repeatPMF (countTrial ν p c) n).map (fun q => ∑ i, q.1 i)

as `PMF ℝ`, for every `c`.  The cost `c` is inert: it is carried by `repeatPMF`
only because `repeatPMF` is stated for cost-carrying runs, and the identity holds
for each choice of it.

Since a caller normally divides by `n` and asks for an event, the corollary
`toOuterMeasure_iidList_countP` states the same fact one post-composition later,
for an arbitrary `f : ℝ → ℝ` (take `f = (· / n)`) and an arbitrary event `T`:

    Pr_{l ∼ iidList ν n}[ f (l.countP p) ∈ T ]
      = Pr_{repeatPMF (countTrial ν p c) n}[ f (∑ i, vᵢ) ∈ T ].

Because the predicate an algorithm tests and the predicate its analysis uses
usually agree only *on the support of `ν`* — an algorithm testing "this sample
avoids the earlier sets" is analysed against "this sample is a first hit", and
the two differ off `ν.support` — `map_countP_iidList_congr` lets the predicate be
replaced by any predicate agreeing with it `ν`-almost surely.  Its engine is
`bind_congr_support`, a general fact about `PMF.bind` that is worth having on its
own.

## Main definitions

* `countTrial ν p c` — one Bernoulli trial with success event `p`, at cost `c`.

## Main results

* `bind_congr_support` — `PMF.bind` only sees the continuation on the support.
* `map_countP_iidList` — **the two laws agree.**  Fully proved.
* `map_countP_iidList_congr` — the predicate may be changed `ν`-a.s.
* `toOuterMeasure_iidList_countP` — the event form.
* `toOuterMeasure_iidList_countP_congr` — the event form with the predicate
  changed `ν`-a.s.

/-! ## The two laws agree -/

/-- **Counting a predicate over `n` i.i.d. samples is summing `n` i.i.d. trials.**

The left-hand side is what an algorithm computes: it draws a *list* of `n`
samples and counts how many satisfy `p`.  The right-hand side is what a
concentration theorem talks about: `n` independent `{0,1}`-valued runs, summed.
The two are equal as laws on `ℝ`, for every `ν`, every `p`, every `n` and every
cost `c`.

The proof is a single induction on `n` along the two recursions, which are the
same recursion: `iidList` conses a fresh `ν`-draw onto `n` further draws and
`repeatPMF` `Fin.cons`es a fresh run onto `n` further runs, so `List.countP_cons`
on one side and `Fin.sum_cons` on the other leave the same `ν.bind`.  No
independence hypothesis appears because in both terms independence *is* the
`PMF.bind`. -/

/-- **The predicate may be changed `ν`-almost surely.**  Only the values of `p`
on `ν.support` affect the law of the count, because every entry of the list is a
`ν`-draw.

This is what makes the identity usable: the predicate an algorithm tests
("`t` lies in none of the earlier sets") and the predicate its analysis uses
("`t` is a first hit of `F j`", which additionally asserts `t ∈ F j`) agree only
on the support of the sampling law. -/

`f = (· / n)`, turning the count into a fraction — and any event `T` of its
value, the two laws assign the same probability.

may be analysed by the concentration theory of `repeatPMF`. -/
