# From a defective sampler to an FPAUS

`Arlib.Approximation.Counting` defines `IsFPAUS` with a **multiplicative**
guarantee: every solution must be returned with probability in the window
`[(1-δ)/|U|, (1+δ)/|U|]`.  The samplers that algorithms actually deliver have two
defects, and neither is of that shape:

* an undetectable **preprocessing failure**, which happens with some probability
  `δ₀` and after which the sampler's law is completely unconstrained.  This
  produces an *additive* `δ₀` perturbation of the output law, not a multiplicative
  one;
* a detectable **`FAIL` output**, which happens with probability at most `3/4`
  (`1/2` after three repetitions, since `(3/4)³ < 1/2`) — **on an instance that
  has something to sample**.

**The `FAIL` bound is conditional on `U ≠ ∅`, and must be.**  The source —

statements are cited by the labels of the authors' manuscript, which is not
distributed with this library — states `Pr[FAIL] ≤ 3/4` under the standing
proviso `T(sⁱ) ≠ ∅` of its preliminaries, and there is no reading under which
the proviso can be
dropped: on an instance with no solutions the only correct output is `FAIL`, so
`Pr[FAIL] = 1` there.  An unguarded `fail_le` therefore contradicts the `empty`
clause below — the two together assert `1 ≤ 3/4` — and makes
`PreprocessedSampler` unsatisfiable for any `g` that takes the value `∅`.
`PreprocessedSampler.fail_le` accordingly carries the hypothesis `(g w).Nonempty`,
exactly as `uniform` does; the empty instance is the business of `empty` alone.

This module closes both gaps, in the two steps [ACJR21, `thm:samplemain`]
takes in one line each.

## Step 1 — additive to multiplicative

This is the step the source elides.  An additive `δ₀`-approximation to the
uniform law on `U` is a multiplicative `(1 ± δ)`-approximation **as soon as
`δ₀ ≤ δ/|U|`**, and that is the entire content of the paper's
`eqn:additiverror`:

```
𝒟(t) = 1/|U| ± δ₀ = 1/|U| ± δ|U|⁻¹ = (1 ± δ)/|U|.
```

`between_of_abs_sub_le` is the arithmetic; `outProbR_mem_Icc_of_additive` is the
form `IsFPAUS.uniform` consumes.  The converse (`abs_sub_le_of_between`) is
immediate and is proved too: the two notions are *equivalent* at the calibration
`δ₀ = δ/|U|`, so nothing is lost by working additively.

The bridge from "the preprocessing fails with probability `δ₀`" to "the output
law is additively `δ₀`-close" is `abs_outProbR_mixPMF_sub_le`: a mixture that
agrees with `μ` except on an event of probability `q` has every output
probability within `q` of `μ`'s.  Crucially the failure branch is *arbitrary* —
a footnote of [ACJR21] says in as many words that the bad event cannot
be detected, so it cannot be retried away, and the lemma assumes nothing about
it.

## Step 2 — driving the `FAIL` rate down

`retryPMF μ k` runs `μ` at most `k` times and returns the first non-`FAIL`
output, or `none` if all `k` attempts fail.  The bound `k` is what keeps this
inside `PMF`: an unbounded `repeat until success` is not a `PMF` term at all
without a termination argument.  Three facts, all exact:

* `outProbR_retryPMF_none` — `Pr[FAIL] = f^k` exactly, where `f = Pr[one attempt
  FAILs]`.  With `f ≤ 1/2` this is `≤ 2^{-k}`;
* `outProbR_retryPMF` — for any event `S` not containing `none`,
  `Pr_k[S] = (∑_{i<k} f^i)·Pr₁[S]`.  The factor does not depend on `S`, so the
  **conditional law given success is exactly that of a single attempt** —
  repetition does not bias the sample.  This is the fact the source asserts
  without proof;
* `retryPMF_cost_le` — `k` attempts cost at most `k·B`.

## Step 3 — assembling an `IsFPAUS`

`PreprocessedSampler` bundles the guarantees of `thm:samplemain`'s sampler, and
`PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS` concludes.  Two points where the statement is more
honest than the source:

**The polynomial-time clause needs `log |U| = poly`.**  `IsFPAUS.polytime` is
polynomial in `log(1/δ)`, and the preprocessing is run at `δ₀ ≈ δ/|U|`, so its
own cost is polynomial in `log(1/δ₀) = log(1/δ) + log|U|`.  That is polynomial in
the instance size *only if* `log|U|` is, which is a hypothesis
(`log_card_poly`) and not a consequence of anything else here.  The source is
right that it holds in its application — `|L_n(𝒯)| = exp(poly(n,m))` — but it is
a hypothesis nonetheless, and the whole point of the calibration
`δ₀ = δ·exp(-poly)` is that `log(1/δ₀)`, not `1/δ₀`, is what the running time
depends on.

**`Θ(log(δ⁻¹|U|))` repetitions are more than are needed.**  The source repeats
`Θ(log(δ⁻¹|L_n(𝒯)|))` times, on the grounds that exhausting all repetitions
"causes another additive `δ|U|⁻¹` error".  It does not: by `outProbR_retryPMF`
the retry loop multiplies *every* solution's probability by the same factor
`1 - f^k`, so the perturbation is already multiplicative and `f^k ≤ δ/2` — that
is, `k = Θ(log δ⁻¹)`, with no `log|U|` — suffices.  `retryCount` takes the
smaller count, and `retryCount_le` records that it is `Θ(log δ⁻¹)`.  The source's
count is sufficient, just larger by a `log|U| = poly(n,m)` factor.

`(3/4)³ < 1/2` is likewise not needed: `PreprocessedSampler` carries the raw
`3/4` bound and `retryCount` is calibrated against `3/4` directly.

## Main definitions

* `mixPMF q ν μ` — the two-point mixture: `ν` with probability `q`, else `μ`.
* `retryPMF μ k` — at most `k` attempts, first non-`FAIL` wins.
* `preTol`, `retryCount`, `retrySampler` — the calibrated assembly.
* `PreprocessedSampler` — the hypotheses of `thm:samplemain`, as a structure.

## Main results

* `between_of_abs_sub_le`, `abs_sub_le_of_between` — Step 1, both directions.
* `outProbR_retryPMF_none`, `outProbR_retryPMF`, `retryPMF_cost_le` — Step 2.
* `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS` — Step 3.
* `retryPMF_cost_ge`, `one_le_retryCount`, `retrySampler_cost_ge` — the cost
  bound in the *other* direction.  An upper bound on a recorded step count is
  satisfied by an algorithm that records nothing, so an upper bound alone is no
  evidence that any work was done; `retrySampler_cost_ge` says that whatever the
  attempts charge, the assembly charges at least as much, because `retryCount δ`
  is never zero on `(0,1)` and so at least one attempt is always run.  Paired
  with `retryPMF_cost_le` it sandwiches the assembled sampler's cost.

Four facts `Arlib.Approximation.Counting` does not state and every computation

and that `outProb` distributes over `PMF.bind`. -/

when this equation is used as a rewrite rule in either direction. -/

/-! ## Two-point mixtures

The preprocessing step of `thm:samplemain` either succeeds — after which the
sampler's law is `μ` — or fails, with probability `δ₀`, after which its law is an
arbitrary `ν`.  That is a two-point mixture, and the only thing needed about it
is that it perturbs every output probability by at most `δ₀`. -/

/-- **The two-point mixture**: run `ν` with probability `q`, otherwise run `μ`.

`q` is clamped to `[0,1]` by `min q 1` so that the definition needs no side
condition; every lemma below carries `q ≤ 1` as a hypothesis and the clamp is
then invisible. -/

/-! ## Step 1 — additive error becomes multiplicative

The arithmetic inside the proof of [ACJR21, `thm:samplemain`].  It is stated first for a bare real
`1/N`, then for `outProb`, and in both directions: at `δ₀ = δ/N` the additive and
the multiplicative guarantees are *equivalent*, so working additively upstream
costs nothing. -/

/-- **Additive to multiplicative.**  A value within an additive `δ₀` of `1/N` is
within a multiplicative `(1 ± δ)` of `1/N`, provided `δ₀ ≤ δ/N`.

This is `eqn:additiverror`.  The hypothesis `δ₀ ≤ δ/N` is the calibration
`δ₀ = δ|U|⁻¹` the source performs; without it the conclusion is simply false, and
the calibration is exactly why the preprocessing has to be run at an exponentially
small tolerance. -/

If the sampler behaves as `μ` except on a preprocessing-failure event of

footnote of [ACJR21] insists that the failure cannot be detected, hence
cannot be conditioned away, and this lemma is the honest accounting of that. -/

/-! ### The `Finset` form

`IsFPAUS.uniform` asks for membership in `Set.Icc ((1-δ)/|U|) ((1+δ)/|U|)`; this
is `between_of_abs_sub_le` transported to that shape, with `N = |U|`. -/

/-- **Step 1, in the shape `IsFPAUS.uniform` consumes.**

An algorithm whose output law is within an additive `δ₀` of uniform on a nonempty
`U`, with `δ₀ ≤ δ/|U|`, returns every solution with probability inside the
multiplicative window `[(1-δ)/|U|, (1+δ)/|U|]`.

No nonemptiness hypothesis is needed — but none is *useful* either.  On an empty
`U` both the hypothesis and the conclusion quantify over no `x`, and the window
`[(1-δ)/0, (1+δ)/0]` is meaningless; that is precisely why `IsFPAUS` guards its
`uniform` clause with `(g w).Nonempty` and discharges the empty case through the
separate `empty` clause instead. -/

/-! ## Step 2 — bounded repeat-until-success

`retryPMF μ k` makes at most `k` attempts and returns the first non-`FAIL`
output.  The bound is essential: an unbounded loop is not a `PMF` term without a
separate termination argument, and `k` is in any case what the running-time
clause has to charge for. -/

/-- **At most `k` attempts, first success wins.**

At `k = 0` there is nothing left to try and the answer is `none` at no cost.  At
`k + 1`, one attempt is made; if it returns a sample it is returned as is, and
otherwise the remaining `k` attempts are made and their cost added to the failed
attempt's.

Failure is *detectable* — that is what `p.1.isSome` tests — which is the whole
difference between this defect and the preprocessing failure of Step 1. -/

For any event `S` of non-`FAIL` outputs, the retry loop's probability is the
single attempt's probability scaled by `∑_{i<k} f^i` — a factor that *does not
depend on `S`*.  Hence the law of the output conditioned on success is exactly
the law of a single attempt conditioned on success, which is what the source
asserts when it says one may "return the first sample obtained from an instance
that did not return `FAIL`".

The hypothesis `none ∉ S` is necessary and not a technicality: for `S = {none}`
the conclusion fails at `k = 0`, where the loop returns `none` with probability
`1` while the right-hand side is `0`. -/

The companion of `retryPMF_cost_le`, and the reason it is worth having: an
*upper* bound on a recorded step count is satisfied by an algorithm that records
`0`, so on its own it is no evidence that any work was done.  If every attempt
charges at least `A`, then so does the loop — provided the loop runs at all,
which is why the statement is about `k + 1` and not `k`.  At `k = 0` the loop
returns `(none, 0)` and the conclusion is false for `A > 0`.

No induction: whichever branch the first attempt takes, its own cost `p.2` is
already a summand of the total. -/

`δ₀ = δ|U|⁻¹` of [ACJR21, `thm:samplemain`] with two pieces of slack: the factor `2`

an empty instance, where `IsFPAUS` asks a different question anyway. -/

model: "the preprocessing fails with probability `δ₀` and thereafter the law is
unconstrained" *is* a two-point mixture, and there is nothing else it could
be. -/

tolerance at which the assembly actually invokes `good` and `bad`, so this is
the weakest form that suffices and the one a caller can discharge. -/

/-! ### The hypotheses of `thm:samplemain` -/

/-- **A sampler with the two defects of `thm:samplemain`.**

`good w δ₀` is the law of one attempt *given that the preprocessing succeeded*;
`bad w δ₀` is its law given that the preprocessing failed, and is completely
unconstrained apart from the empty-instance and cost clauses.

* `uniform` — conditioned on not returning `FAIL`, a good attempt is *exactly*
  uniform on `g w`.  This is `lem:sampmain` combined with Property 2, and it is
  an equality, not a window: all the approximation lives in the preprocessing.
* `fail_le` — a good attempt **on an instance with a solution** returns `FAIL`
  with probability at most `3/4` ([ACJR21], under its standing proviso
  `T(sⁱ) ≠ ∅`).  The source then repeats three times to
  reach `1/2`; that step is not needed here, `retryCount` being calibrated
  against `3/4` directly.  The `(g w).Nonempty` guard is not decoration: without
  it this clause and `empty` assert `1 ≤ 3/4` on an instance with no solutions,
  and the structure is unsatisfiable whenever `g` takes the value `∅`.
* `empty` — on an instance with no solutions *both* branches always return
  `FAIL`.  The source justifies this ([ACJR21, `thm:samplemain`]) by observing that
  membership in `L_n(𝒯)` is decidable in polynomial time, so a candidate output
  can always be checked before being returned — which is why the clause may be
  imposed on the failure branch too.
* `cost` — both branches run in time polynomial in the instance size and in
  `log(1/δ₀)`.  Note `log(1/δ₀)`, not `1/δ₀`: this is exactly what makes running
  the preprocessing at the exponentially small `δ₀ = δ·exp(-poly)` affordable. -/

/-! ### The running-time bookkeeping

`log(1/δ₀) = log 2 + log(|g w| + 1) + log(1/δ)`, so the preprocessing's own
running time is polynomial in the instance size only when `log |g w|` is.  That
hypothesis is `log_card_poly` below and it is the one the source leaves
implicit. -/

`log 2 ≤ 1`; the middle term is the one that needs `log_card_poly`. -/

/-- **The headline of Step 3.**

Given a `PreprocessedSampler` and the hypothesis that `log |g w|` is polynomially
bounded in the instance size, `retrySampler` is an FPAUS.

The three clauses come from the three steps: `uniform` from Step 1
(`outProbR_mem_Icc_of_additive`) applied to the two additive errors of
`abs_outProbR_retrySampler_sub_le`; `empty` from `outProbR_retrySampler_none`;
and `polytime` from `retrySampler_cost_le`, `retryCount_le` and
`ceil_log_preTol_le`.

**`log_card_poly` is a genuine hypothesis, and the source does not state it.**
The preprocessing is run at `δ₀ = δ/(2(|g w|+1))`, so its running time is
polynomial in `log(1/δ₀) = log(1/δ) + log|g w| + O(1)`.  Nothing forces
`log |g w|` to be polynomial in `size w` — for a general `g` it need not be —
and without it the assembled sampler is not polynomial-time.  In the source's
application it holds because `|L_n(𝒯)| ≤ exp(poly(n,m))`, which is the content of
"`δ₀ = δ exp(-poly(n,m))` does not affect the stated polynomial runtime"
([ACJR21, `thm:samplemain`]).  The clause is polynomial in `log(1/δ₀)`, never in
`1/δ₀`. -/

`IsFPAUS` only ever looks at `A w δ` for `δ ∈ (0,1)`, so an algorithm that agrees
with an FPAUS on that range is one too.  This is what lets a caller present the
sampler of `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS` in whatever form its own development
produced, rather than as the literal `retrySampler` term. -/
