# The Rademacher space as a finite probability space, and the moment method

The `avg` functional of `Rademacher.lean` is the expectation under the uniform
measure on sign patterns.  Here that measure is packaged as an honest
`Arlib.Probability.FinProb` — the uniform mass `2^{-|ι|}` on `ι → Bool` — so that the general
tools of `Arlib.Probability` (Markov's inequality) apply.

* `radProb ι` — the uniform Rademacher probability space.
* `radProb_Ex` — its expectation is exactly `avg`.
* `avg_markov` — Markov's inequality read through `avg`.
* `avg_pow_tail` — the **moment method**: a bound `avg (Y ^ (2k)) ≤ B` on the
  `2k`-th moment turns into the tail bound `Pr[Y ≥ c] ≤ B / c^{2k}`, the shape in
  which Cohen–Peng's `momBound` is consumed.

No `sorry`.
