# The fixed-query sign-flip contraction (exact per-query L4 comparison)

Cohen–Peng's `lem:comparison` invokes the Ledoux–Talagrand contraction principle
to strip the absolute value `|·|` (a `1`-Lipschitz map) from inside a Rademacher
sign process without inflating its even moments.  This file proves the **exact,
per-query** form of that fact:

* `avg_abs_sign_pow_eq` — for a *fixed* coefficient vector `c : ν → ℝ` and every
  `k`,
  `𝔼_σ (∑ᵢ σᵢ |cᵢ|)^(2k) = 𝔼_σ (∑ᵢ σᵢ cᵢ)^(2k)`.

The equality is **exact — there is no contraction factor `2`** — precisely because
for a *fixed* query the sign `sgn cᵢ` of each coordinate is deterministic.  The
map `σᵢ ↦ σᵢ · sgn cᵢ` is then a *measure-preserving involution* of the finite
sign space `ν → Bool`: flipping `σᵢ` exactly on the coordinates where `cᵢ < 0`
carries the process `∑ᵢ σᵢ |cᵢ|` onto `∑ᵢ σᵢ cᵢ` bijectively, so every symmetric
functional — in particular each even moment — is literally unchanged.  No Lipschitz
slack is spent.

The proof is entirely elementary and uses only the `avg` machinery of
`Rademacher.lean` together with `Equiv.sum_comp` (a bijective reindexing of a
finite sum):

1. `abs_eq_Sgn_mul` : `|t| = sgn(0 ≤ t) · t` — the pointwise sign identity.
2. `Sgn_not` : `sgn(!b) = -sgn b` — flipping a sign bit negates.
3. the involution `σ ↦ (fun i => if 0 ≤ cᵢ then σᵢ else !σᵢ)`, packaged as an
   `Equiv.Perm`, which turns `∑ᵢ σᵢ |cᵢ|` into `∑ᵢ (eσ)ᵢ cᵢ`;
4. `avg_comp_perm` : `𝔼_σ f(eσ) = 𝔼_σ f` — precomposing the average with a
   permutation of the sign space leaves it invariant.

The genuinely harder **supremum-level** contraction — the version of
`lem:comparison` that is *uniform over all queries `x`*, i.e. that contracts a
whole supremum-of-signed-processes — is a separate matter: it requires the
machinery of suprema of stochastic processes (the real Ledoux–Talagrand
comparison theorem) and is not addressed here.

No `sorry`.

/-- **Absolute value as a deterministic sign times the value.**  `|t|` equals the
sign `sgn(0 ≤ t) ∈ {±1}` times `t`.  For a fixed query this fixes each
coordinate's sign, which is what makes the contraction below exact. -/

/-- **The Rademacher average is invariant under any permutation of the sign
space.**  `𝔼_σ f(eσ) = 𝔼_σ f` for every `e : Equiv.Perm (ν → Bool)`.  The
numerator `∑_σ f(eσ) = ∑_σ f σ` is a bijective reindexing (`Equiv.sum_comp`) and
the normalising denominator `2^|ν|` is untouched. -/

/-! ## The fixed-query contraction -/

/-- **Exact per-query sign-flip contraction (`lem:comparison`, fixed `x`).**
Stripping the absolute value inside a Rademacher sign process leaves its even
moments *unchanged*:
`𝔼_σ (∑ᵢ σᵢ |cᵢ|)^(2k) = 𝔼_σ (∑ᵢ σᵢ cᵢ)^(2k)`.

Because `c` is fixed, the sign of each `cᵢ` is deterministic, so flipping `σᵢ`
exactly on the negative coordinates is a measure-preserving involution of the
sign space `ν → Bool` carrying one process onto the other.  Hence *every*
symmetric functional — here the `2k`-th moment — is identical, with **no**
contraction factor. -/
