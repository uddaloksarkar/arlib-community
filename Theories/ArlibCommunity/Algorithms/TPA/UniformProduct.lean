# The product of `m` independent uniforms: identifying `tpaTail`

`ArlibCommunity.Algorithms.TPA.Count` introduces the closed form

  `tpaTail m c = 1 - c · ∑_{j < m} (ln(1/c))^j / j!`

and proves the one-dimensional recursion `∫_c^1 tpaTail m (c/u) du = tpaTail (m+1) c`
that characterises it.  This file closes the remaining gap: it proves that the
*intended* reading of `tpaTail` is correct, namely

  `P(U₁ ⋯ U_m > c) = tpaTail m c`   for independent `Uniform(0,1)` variables.

Without this identification the whole TPA analysis rests on an unproved reading
of a formula.

## The set-up

The uniform law on `[0,1]` is `unifUnit = volume.restrict (Set.Icc 0 1)`; since
`Real.volume_Icc` gives it total mass `1` it is a probability measure, and
`MeasureTheory.Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin m => unifUnit)` is the law of `m`
independent uniforms.  The event `{U₁ ⋯ U_m > c}` is the measurable set
`{u : Fin m → ℝ | c < ∏ i, u i}`, and `volume_prod_gt` computes its measure.

## The argument

Induction on `m`.

* `m = 0`: the empty product is `1`, so the event is everything when `c < 1` and
  the measure is `1 = tpaTail 0 c`.  **This is the only place `c < 1` is used**,
  and it is genuinely needed: at `c = 1` the event `{1 > 1}` is empty while
  `tpaTail 0 1 = 1`.  See the discussion under "Sharpness" below.

* `m+1`: `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove` with `i = 0` identifies
  the product measure on `Fin (m+1)` with `unifUnit.prod (Measure.pi …)`, under
  which the event becomes `{p | c < p.1 * ∏ j, p.2 j}` (`Fin.prod_univ_succ`).
  Tonelli (`MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_apply`) turns its measure into
  `∫⁻ u₀, μ_m {v | c < u₀ * ∏ v} ∂unifUnit`.  The inner measure is:
  - `0` for `u₀ ≤ c`, because `μ_m` lives on `[0,1]^m` where the product is at
    most `1`, so `u₀ · ∏ v ≤ u₀ ≤ c` (`measure_setOf_mul_prod_gt_eq_zero`); this
    is the "set is null" route, which avoids ever evaluating `tpaTail` outside
    `(0,1)`;
  - `ENNReal.ofReal (tpaTail m (c/u₀))` for `c < u₀ ≤ 1` by the induction
    hypothesis, since then `0 < c/u₀ < 1`.
  So the `lintegral` collapses to one over `Set.Ioc c 1`, which converts to the
  Bochner interval integral `∫ u in c..1, tpaTail m (c/u)` — this needs
  `tpaTail_nonneg` and the integrability supplied by
  `ArlibCommunity.Algorithms.TPA.continuousOn_tpaTail_div` — and `ArlibCommunity.Algorithms.TPA.tpaTail_succ` finishes.

## Sharpness of the hypotheses

`Count.lean` records neither `c < 1` nor `c ≤ 1`, and both boundaries matter:

* At `c = 1` the identification **fails, and exactly at `m = 0`**:
  `tpaTail m 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` for `m ≥ 1`, which is the correct value of
  `P(U₁ ⋯ U_m > 1)`, but `tpaTail 0 1 = 1` whereas
  `P(empty product > 1) = P(1 > 1) = 0`.  So `m = 0` is the sole obstruction and
  `hc1 : c < 1` is exactly what removes it.
* For `c > 1` the closed form is not a probability at all (it can be negative),
  while the true probability is `0`.

Both `0 < c` and `c < 1` are therefore assumed throughout.

## The payoff

`prob_exactly_eq_poissonPMF`: the probability that a run needs *exactly* `m`
contractions — the difference of two consecutive tails — is the Poisson mass
`Arlib.Probability.poissonPMF (ln(1/c)) m`.  This is `ArlibCommunity.Algorithms.TPA.tpaTail_sub` transported
along the identification, and it is the statement the TPA analysis actually uses.

/-! ## Nonnegativity of the closed form

To move between `ENNReal.ofReal` and reals we need `tpaTail m c ≥ 0` on the
intended domain `(0, 1]`.  Deriving this from the probabilistic meaning would be
circular, so we prove it directly from the exponential series: with
`A = -log c ≥ 0`, every partial sum of `∑ A^j/j!` is at most `e^A = 1/c`. -/

/-- **The closed form is a probability.**  For `c ∈ (0, 1]`, `tpaTail m c ≥ 0`,
because `c · ∑_{j<m} A^j/j! ≤ c · e^A = 1` with `A = -log c ≥ 0`. -/
