# The two-phase TPA schedule: the arithmetic of the run counts

TPA's counter is `Poisson(A)` with `A = ln(μ(B)/μ(B'))` (`ArlibCommunity.Algorithms.TPA.Count`), so
to make `k/r` concentrate one wants `r ≈ A` — but `A` is the unknown.  Hence the
two-phase schedule: a cheap first phase with `r₁ = 2 ln(2/δ)` produces a rough
`Â₁`, and the second phase uses

  `r₂ = 2 (Â₁ + √Â₁ + 2) · [ε'² − ε'³]⁻¹ · ln(4/δ)`,   `ε' = ln(1+ε)`.

This file isolates the **purely arithmetic** content of that analysis — the
inequalities that must hold for the Chernoff exponents to clear `ln(2/δ)` and
`ln(4/δ)`.  Separating them from the probability is worth doing: it is exactly
here that the published proof goes wrong, and stating each step as a standalone
real inequality makes the missing hypothesis visible.

## What the arithmetic reveals

* **Phase one is exact, not approximate.**  The threshold `t = A − 3/2 − √(A−7/4)`
  is precisely the fixed point of `x ↦ x + √x + 2` (`phase1_threshold_fixed`),
  because `t` is the perfect square `(√(A−7/4) − 1/2)²`.  So the failure event
  `{Â₁ + √Â₁ + 2 < A}` is *exactly* `{Â₁ < t}` (`phase1_event_subset`), with no
  slack lost.

* **Phase two forces `1 ≤ A`.**  Substituting `r₂` into the upper-tail exponent
  reduces the requirement to `(1 − ε'/A)/(1 − ε') ≥ 1`, i.e. to `A ≥ 1`
  (`phase2_upper_budget`).  The source paper states its Theorem 5 for an
  arbitrary poset and never records this (the schedule analysed here matches
  Mark Huber, *Approximation Algorithms for the Normalizing Constant of Gibbs
  Distributions*, Ann. Appl. Probab. **25**(2):974–985, 2015, arXiv:1206.2689,
  but the rest of this sub-area attributes itself to Huber–Schott 2010; see
  `Arlib/Algorithms/TPA.lean`); for `#(𝓛) ∈ {1,2}` the displayed chain
  of inequalities does not close.  The lower tail (`phase2_lower_budget`) needs
  only `A > 0`.

* **The payoff is a two-line exponential fact.**  `relative_error_of_log_error`
  converts additive accuracy `ln(1+ε)` on the log scale into multiplicative
  accuracy `1 + ε`, which is the form the theorem is stated in.

Throughout, `e` is the paper's `ε' = ln(1+ε)` and `d` is the target log-failure
budget (`ln(2/δ)` or `ln(4/δ)`).
