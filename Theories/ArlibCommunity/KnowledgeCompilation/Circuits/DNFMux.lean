# The mux `(x ∧ ψ) ∨ (¬x ∧ φ)`, performed on DNFs

The DNF-level ingredients for the paper's existential-quantification corollary
(`thm: ex`, [VS24]).  That corollary takes the two functions
`f`, `g` and the v-tree `T` produced by `thm: union`, glues them with a fresh
variable `x` into a single function `f_C`, and observes that `∃x f_C ≡ f ∨ g`,
so that a small d-SDNNF for `∃x f_C` would give one for `f ∨ g`.

## A deliberate deviation from the paper's proof

The paper glues at the *circuit* level: given d-SDNNFs `C_f` and `C_g` respecting
`T` it forms the circuit `⟨C⟩ = (x ∧ ⟨C_f⟩) ∨ (¬x ∧ ⟨C_g⟩)`, three new nodes on
top of the disjoint union of the two DAGs.  **We do not do that**, and the
decision is recorded here rather than left to be rediscovered.

Our circuits are DAGs with children named by `Fin size` (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.1), so
a disjoint union of two circuits is not a pairing of two objects: it is a
renumbering of every node of the second one, together with a transport of
`child_lt`, `valAt`, `varsAt`, `Respects`, `Decomposable` and `Deterministic`
along that renumbering.  None of the rest of the area needs index-shifting
machinery — `DNFtoCircuit` builds its one circuit by *extension*, never by
relocation, precisely to avoid a renumbering lemma (see its module docstring) —
and `thm: ex` is not a good reason to introduce it.

So we perform the same mux one level down, on the DNFs, and hand the result to
the compiler that is already there.  `Circuits.DNFtoCircuit` turns an unambiguous
`k`-DNF with `ℓ` terms into a d-SDNNF respecting *any prescribed v-tree*, of size
`ℓ·(2k+2) + 1`.  The mux of two unambiguous `k`-DNFs is an unambiguous
`(k+1)`-DNF with the sum of the term counts (`unambiguous_muxDNF`,
`isKDNF_muxDNF`, `numTerms_muxDNF`), so composing gives a d-SDNNF respecting the
enlarged v-tree `T'`, of size `(ℓ_ψ + ℓ_φ)·(2k+4) + 1`.

This is legitimate because both routes deliver the same thing to `thm: union`:
a d-SDNNF, of size linear in the two inputs, respecting a prescribed v-tree, and
computing a function whose `∃x` is `f ∨ g`.  The paper's route starts from
circuits and ours from the DNFs those circuits were themselves compiled from, and
the only place either is consumed is as the upper-bound half of the corollary,
where all that is read off is the size and the class.  What we give up is the
ability to mux two circuits handed to us from *outside*; nothing in this area
ever does that.

## The fresh variable, and why quantification lands back in `V`

The fresh `x` is `Sum.inr ()` in `V ⊕ Unit`, and the original variables are
`Sum.inl`-tagged.  This is the one design choice that pays for itself downstream.

`existsFresh` projects the fresh variable away, `def: trans` clause 2
([VS24, `def: trans`]), and it maps `(V ⊕ Unit → Bool) → Bool` to
`(V → Bool) → Bool`.  So `∃x f_C` is literally a function of the *original*
variables, which is what the paper's `∃x f_C ≡ f ∨ g` asserts, and
`existsFresh_eval_muxDNF` is an equation between two functions of type
`(V → Bool) → Bool` with no coercion, no restriction of a domain, and no
partition-transfer lemma.  Had the fresh variable been an extra element of `V`
itself, every consumer would have had to carry the fact that `f` and `g` do not
mention it.

## Terms, and where the `+1` in the width comes from

`Term.width` is the *literal* count (`Finset.card` of the literal set), not the
variable count.  `embedTerm` preserves it exactly, since `Sum.inl` is injective
on literals (`inlLit_injective`), and prefixing the mux literal raises it by at
most one — at most, not exactly, because a term is allowed to be inconsistent and
nothing here needs it not to be.  Hence `IsKDNF k → IsKDNF k → IsKDNF (k+1)`.

Unambiguity is the *counting* form of `Circuits.DNF`, so it is not enough that
the two halves are semantically exclusive: the satisfied-term *list* of the mux
must have length at most one.  It does, and for the same reason the paper's
`∨`-node is deterministic — a satisfied term of the first half forces
`α (Sum.inr ()) = true` and one of the second forces `false`, so one half
contributes an empty filter and the other contributes exactly the filter of its
own DNF, transported along an injective map.

The paper obtains a circuit of size `O(n)` by gluing two circuits of size `n`;
we obtain one of size linear in the two term counts by compiling the muxed DNF.
The two agree on everything `thm: union` reads off.

true of any small circuit and says nothing about `ψ` or `φ`. It is what makes
