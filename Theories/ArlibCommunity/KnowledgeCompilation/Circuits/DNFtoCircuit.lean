# From an unambiguous DNF to a d-SDNNF

The upper-bound half of the paper's main theorem (`thm: main`,
[VS24, `thm: main`], proof at [VS24, §4.2]).  The paper's
whole argument is one sentence:

> since every term of `ψ'` is a conjunction of `O(km)` literals, they all admit
> a d-DNNF respecting `T` of size `O(km)`.  By taking the disjunction of all
> such d-DNNF we get a d-DNNF for `ψ'` respecting `T` [...].  Here determinism
> follows as `ψ'` is unambiguous.

This file is that sentence, made into an actual circuit.  Nothing here depends on
any imported hardness result: the statement is `unambiguous DNF ⟹ d-SDNNF of size
`O(ℓ·k)`, it is fully constructive, and it is reused verbatim by `thm: sep` and
by the disjunction/quantification separations (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-PAPER-INVENTORY.md`, T8/T10).

## What is actually being built

`exists_isdSDNNF_of_unambiguous` is a *construction*: the work is producing the
`gate : Fin size → Gate V size` function, discharging `child_lt`, and then
proving `eval`, `Respects`, `Decomposable`, `Deterministic` of the result.  The
concrete circuit is `dnfCircuit T ψ`, and it is a DAG, as `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.1
insists — a list of gates whose children are earlier positions, not a tree.  No
sharing is exploited (the size bound is the same either way), but nothing in the
encoding rules it out.

## A builder, because `Fin size` is a bad type to build in

`NNF` names children by `Fin size` with `size` the *final* node count, so a
circuit under construction cannot be an `NNF`: every intermediate stage would
need re-indexing as the circuit grows.  So the file introduces `RawGate`, the
same gate with `ℕ`-valued children, a validity predicate `RawValid` (every child
is an earlier position — literally `child_lt`), and `RawValid.toNNF`, which
converts once at the end and changes neither the nodes nor their number.

Every building function takes the program built so far and *extends* it, so the
final program `L` has each intermediate as a prefix.  All the intermediate
specifications are therefore stated against an ambient `L` extending the block in
question, and `getElem_of_prefix` is the only transfer lemma needed.  Building
blocks at an offset and then relocating them would need a full renumbering lemma;
this way there is none.

## Respecting a v-tree: recurse on the tree, not on the term

The paper says a conjunction of literals admits a d-DNNF respecting *any* v-tree
`T`, and that is true, but the circuit is not canonical and the choice matters.
`Respects` demands, for each `∧`-node, a node of `T` whose two children *contain*
the two `∧`-children's variable sets.  A term `{x, y}` built as `∧(y, x)` against
`T = node (leaf x) (leaf y)` does *not* respect `T`, even though `∧(x, y)` does.

So `termCore` recurses on `T`: at `s = node sl sr` the sub-circuit for `sl` goes
left and the one for `sr` goes right, and `s` itself is the witnessing v-tree
node.  The invariant `termCore_varsAt` — the block for `s` only mentions
variables below `s` — is then exactly what `Respects` asks for, and there is no
search and no side condition.  Getting this backwards is the main way to waste
effort here.

## Pruning, and why the bound is in the width

Recursing on `T` would give a block of size `|T|` per term, and the bound would
be in the size of the v-tree rather than in the width of the term.  So subtrees
of `T` carrying no literal of `t` are dropped: `termCore` returns an *optional*
root, `none` meaning "constantly `1`, nothing emitted", and an `∧`-node with a
pruned side collapses to its other side.  Only a branching point where both sides
carry a literal costs a node, so a term meeting `m` leaves of `T` costs `2m - 1`
nodes (`termCore_length`), and `m ≤ width(t)`.

## Where unambiguity is spent

Exactly once, in `dnfExt_det`, at the `∨`-node joining a term block to the chain
for the remaining terms: an assignment firing both children would satisfy two
terms of `ψ`.  Every other `∨`-node is another link of the same chain, and there
are no others anywhere — that is `termExt_not_disj`, and it is what makes
`Deterministic` follow from a statement about the chain.  This is the reason the
paper needs unambiguous DNFs at all.

Being a *producer*, this file has the easy side of the reachability convention
of `Circuits/NNF.lean`: `Respects` and `Deterministic` need only be established
at the nodes reachable from the source, and what is proved here holds at every
index of `Fin size`, reachable or not.  The reachability hypothesis is therefore
discarded on entry to `dnfCircuit_respects` and `dnfCircuit_deterministic`.

## The bound is explicit

`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5: `∑_{t ∈ ψ} (2·width(t) + 2) + 1`, and `ℓ·(2k + 2) + 1` for a
`k`-DNF with `ℓ` terms.  Not `O(·)`.

/-! ## A builder for NNF circuits

`NNF` stores its children as `Fin size` with `size` the *final* node count, which
makes it a bad type to build a circuit *in*: every intermediate stage would have
to be re-indexed as the circuit grows.  We therefore assemble circuits as a
`List (RawGate V)` — the same straight-line program with `ℕ`-valued children —
and convert once at the end.  The list *is* the DAG; `toNNF` is a change of
representation, not a change of object, and in particular the node count is the
list length throughout. -/

/-! ## The circuit for a single term

A term is a conjunction of literals, and the paper says it "admits a d-DNNF
respecting `T`" for *any* v-tree `T`.  That is true, but the circuit is not
canonical: the way the `∧`-nodes are nested must follow `T`, because `Respects`
demands, for each `∧`-node, a v-tree node whose two children *contain* the two
children's variable sets.  The construction below therefore recurses on `T`, not
on the term: at a v-tree node `s = node sl sr` it puts the sub-circuit for `sl`
on the left and the sub-circuit for `sr` on the right, so that `s` itself is the
v-tree node witnessing `Respects` — with no search and no side condition.

The second ingredient is pruning, and it is what makes the size bound a bound in
the *width* of the term rather than in the size of `T`: a subtree of `T` carrying
no variable of the term contributes the constant `1` and is simply omitted, and
an `∧`-node with an omitted side is replaced by its other side.  `termCore`
therefore returns an *optional* root — `none` meaning "constantly true, no node
emitted" — and only a branching point where both sides really carry a literal
costs an `∧`-node.  The count comes out at `2m - 1` nodes for a term meeting `m`
leaves of `T`, which is `termCore_length`. -/

empty term, which is satisfied by everything.  Rather than propagate the option
into the disjunction chain, `termExt` closes it off with a single `1`-node, so
that every term block has an honest root and the chain below has one case fewer.
The price is one node on a block that would otherwise be empty. -/

end TermCircuit

/-! ## The disjunction of the term blocks

The blocks are laid end to end and joined by a right-nested chain of `∨`-nodes,
one per term, terminated by the constant `0` for the empty DNF.  Nothing about
the v-tree is involved: `Respects` constrains `∧`-nodes only, and the chain
contains none.

Determinism is where unambiguity is spent, and it is spent exactly once.  The
`∨`-node joining the block of `t` to the chain for the remaining terms has, as
its two children, a node computing `t` and a node computing the disjunction of
the rest; those cannot both fire, because an assignment satisfying `t` and one of
the later terms would satisfy two terms of the DNF.  Every other `∨`-node of the
circuit is another link of the same chain, and there are no others at all —
`termExt_not_disj` is what says so. -/

An unambiguous DNF admits a d-SDNNF respecting *any* prescribed v-tree over its
variables, of size at most `∑_{t ∈ ψ} (2·width(t) + 2) + 1`.

The v-tree is universally quantified, which is the whole point: `thm: main` needs
a *single* circuit that is structured, and the freedom to fix `T` first and build
around it is what the term-by-term construction buys.  Determinism is the only
consequence of unambiguity used, and it is used only at the `∨`-nodes joining the
term blocks. -/
