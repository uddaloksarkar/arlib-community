# Figure 1: a worked structured d-DNNF, and the v-tree it respects

The paper's Figure 1 ([VS24, §2]) draws a v-tree `T` on the left
and a circuit `C` on the right, asserts that `C` is a structured d-DNNF
respecting `T`, and states the formula it computes:

```
⟨C⟩ = (a ∧ b ∧ ¬c) ∨ (a ∧ b ∧ c ∧ e) ∨ (a ∧ b ∧ c ∧ d ∧ ¬e)
```

This file transcribes both pictures and proves all four claims: the circuit
computes that formula (`eval_eq_caption`), the v-tree is well formed
(`wellFormed_T`), the circuit respects it (`respects_T`), and it is decomposable
(`decomposable`), deterministic (`deterministic`) and hence a d-SDNNF
(`isdSDNNF`).

## Why a worked example is worth formalizing

The definitions in `Circuits/NNF.lean` and `Circuits/VTree.lean` are the ones
every lower bound in this area is stated against, and they are exactly the kind
of definition that can be subtly wrong while looking right — an off-by-one in
`Respects`, a quantifier the wrong way round, a `Decomposable` that quantifies
over indices rather than nodes.  A single concrete circuit that the *paper*
independently says is a d-SDNNF, checked against the *paper's* own statement of
what it computes, is a test the definitions can fail.

Two things in particular are pinned down here.  First, the caption's formula is
an answer to check against rather than a restatement of the circuit: nothing in
`eval_eq_caption` mentions the gates, so the theorem is a genuine confrontation
of the circuit with the paper's claim about it (it agrees).  Second, the six
`∧`-nodes of `C` are witnessed by *four different* nodes of `T` — `Tab` for the
node `a ∧ b`, `Tabc` for the two nodes that attach `c`, `T` itself for the two
that attach the `{d, e}` side, and `Tde` for `d ∧ ¬e`.  The common misreading of
`respects` as `∃ t, ∀ g` (see the module docstring of `Circuits/VTree.lean`)
would therefore *not* be provable here, so `respects_T` is evidence that the
definition has the quantifiers in the paper's order.

## The encoding, and how the proofs stay cheap

`NNF` indexes nodes by `Fin size`, so the circuit is the gate function
`G : Fin 15 → Gate Var 15` together with `root = 14`; the drawing's node names
appear in the comments on `G`.  Node indices increase towards the source, which
is what `child_lt` demands.

Every case analysis in this file is stated on the raw `G`, never on
`C.gate : Fin C.size → _`.  This is not a cosmetic choice: `fin_cases` needs a
numeral, and `C.size` is a projection, not a numeral, so the same lemma phrased
on `C.gate` is not reachable by case analysis at all.  Since `C.gate i = G i`
holds by `rfl`, `conj_inv` and `disj_inv` below apply verbatim to goals about
`C`, and they reduce the six `∧`-nodes and two `∨`-nodes to a fixed list — after
which the child indices are *determined*, recovered from the hypothesis by
injectivity of `Gate.conj` rather than by a second and third case split.

Nothing semantic goes through `decide`: `valAt` and `varsAt` are well-founded
recursions, which the kernel does not reduce.  They are computed instead by the
unfolding lemmas of `Circuits/NNF.lean` applied to gate equations that hold by
`rfl` — `val_0` through `val_14` and `vars_0` through `vars_12` below.

## Reachability

`Decomposable`, `Deterministic` and `Respects` are relativized to the nodes
reachable from the source.  The proofs here ignore that hypothesis and establish
the conditions at *every* index, which is strictly stronger and is available
because the inversion lemmas classify all of `Fin 15`.  That the distinction is
vacuous for this circuit is itself recorded: `reaches_all` shows every one of
the fifteen indices is reachable from the root, i.e. the figure draws no dead
nodes.

The value at each node, computed bottom-up with the unfolding lemmas of
`Circuits/NNF.lean`.  The gate equations are supplied by `rfl`; `valAt` itself is
a well-founded recursion and does not reduce in the kernel, so this is the only
way to compute it. -/
