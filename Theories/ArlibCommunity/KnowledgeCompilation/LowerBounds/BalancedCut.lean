# The balanced cut of a v-tree

The first half of the rectangle lemma (`lem: rectangle`,
[VS24, `lem: rectangle`]), and the step that makes the whole bridge between
circuits and communication complexity possible.

The rectangle lemma says that a small d-SDNNF for `f` yields a small rectangular
partition of `f⁻¹(1)` — but `Par₁` is a *best-partition* measure, minimised over
**balanced** partitions only, so before any rectangle can be extracted one must
produce a balanced partition to extract it with respect to.  The circuit itself
does not obviously supply one.  The v-tree does.

## The separator

Every full binary tree has a node carrying between a third and two thirds of the
leaves.  Walk down from the root, always into the heavier child, and stop the
first time the current node carries at most `2N/3`.  The node just before the
stop carried more than `2N/3`, and a heavier child carries at least half its
parent, so the stopping node carries more than `N/3`.

Cutting at that node splits the variables into `var(t)` and its complement, and
`|Z| ≤ 3|var(t)|` together with `3|var(t)| ≤ 2|Z|` is exactly balancedness for
the resulting partition (`VarPartition.balanced_iff_left`).

## Why `2 ≤ |Z|` is needed, and is not a blemish

The hypothesis is genuinely necessary rather than an artefact: a v-tree on a
single variable is one leaf, whose only node carries all of `Z`, and no partition
of a one-element set is balanced at all — one block is empty.  This is the
existence statement whose absence was recorded as a gap when
`Arlib/Communication/Measures.lean` was written; the bound `2 ≤ |Z|` is where it lives.

## What this does not yet do

This file produces the *partition*.  It does not produce the rectangles: that is
the second half of the rectangle lemma, and it needs the certificate machinery
(unique proof trees for a deterministic circuit) that nothing here has yet.  The
two halves are independent, and this one is the reusable one — any argument that
needs "a balanced partition compatible with the v-tree" can take it from here.

Stated with a free `N` so that the induction can compare every node against the
*global* variable count rather than against its own subtree, which is what makes
the descent go through.  The leaf case is vacuous: a leaf carries one variable,
and `2N < 3` contradicts `2 ≤ N`. -/

/-! ## A non-vacuity check

`exists_balanced_subtree` would be worthless if its hypotheses were unsatisfiable,
so we discharge them on a concrete tree.  This is cheap here — unlike `NNF.valAt`,
`VTree.vars` and `VTree.WellFormed` are *structural* recursions, so they reduce in
the kernel and `decide` works.  (Contrast gap G4 in `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md`, which is about
the circuit side, where it does not.) -/
