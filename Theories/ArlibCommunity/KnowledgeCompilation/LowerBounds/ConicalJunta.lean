# Conical juntas, and why `∨` is hard for them

This file formalizes §3 of Göös–Kiefer–Yuan, *Lower bounds for unambiguous
automata via communication complexity* (ICALP 2022), whose source is at
[GKY22, §3].  That section is the one place in the chain
behind `Imported.UnionHard` where a *new theorem* is proved rather than cited,
and this file proves it.

## Where this sits

`thm: union` of the knowledge-compilation paper rests on `Imported.UnionHard`,
which Vinall-Smeeth extracts from the proof of Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's Theorem 2.
Unwinding that proof gives a chain, and it is worth being explicit about which
links are theorems here and which remain imported:

| step | status |
| --- | --- |
| hardness of `¬` for approximate conical juntas — GJPW18, Lemma 8 | **imported** |
| `∨` is at least as hard as `¬` — GKY, Lemma 14 | **proved here** |
| lifting `deg⁺` to nonnegative rank — GLMWZ16, Kothari21 | **imported** |
| `Par₁ ≥ rk⁺` | proved, `Arlib/Communication/NonnegRank.lean` |
| `deg⁺(f) ≤ UC₁(f)` for unambiguous DNFs | **proved here** |

So this file does not make anything unconditional.  What it does is replace one
opaque hypothesis by a proof resting on two *named, more primitive* ones — and
the piece that is Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's own contribution is now checked.

## Conjunctions, not juntas

The source gives two equivalent definitions: a conical `d`-junta is a
non-negative combination of functions depending on at most `d` variables, or
equivalently of width-`d` conjunctions.  The junta form is far more convenient
for products — a product of juntas is a junta, with the variable sets union'd —
but it is **wrong for the main proof**.  `negp_to_or` needs that a conjunction
on the doubled variable set `V ⊕ V` factors as `C(x,y) = C₁(x)·C₂(y)`, and a
junta does not factor: `h(x,y) = [x₁ = y₁]` depends on two variables and is not
a product.  So conjunctions it is, and they are exactly the `Finset (Lit V)` of
`Circuits/DNF.lean` — a `Finset (Lit V)` with `Term.Sat` and `Term.width`
already in place, including `Term.sat_union`, which is the product rule.

## No numeric degree

`deg⁺_ε(f)` is an infimum, and the development's standing policy
(`Arlib/Communication/Measures.lean`) is that an `sInf` over a possibly-empty set of
naturals is a trap.  Everything here is stated with the predicate
`HasConicalApprox d ε f` — "some conical `d`-junta `ε`-approximates `f`" — and
lower bounds appear as its negation.  `deg⁺_ε(f) > d` is `¬ HasConicalApprox d ε f`.

## The one hypothesis that is neither proved nor imported from a paper

The two claims below live on opposite sides of an LP.  `negp_to_or` is a
statement about **dual certificates** and its proof constructs one;
`neg_to_negp` is a statement about **primal** approximations and its proof
constructs one.  Composing them, as the source does at the end of its proof of
Lemma 14, needs to turn "no good conical approximation" back into "a dual
certificate exists" — which is *strong* LP duality, and the source says so:
"by strong LP duality, `deg⁺_δ(f) > d` iff there exists a feasible solution `Φ`".

Weak duality — a certificate rules out an approximation — is elementary and is
**proved** here (`Separates.not_hasConicalApprox`).  Strong duality is not; it is
a standard fact about finitely generated cones (Farkas), not something specific
to this paper, and it is carried as an explicit hypothesis wherever it is needed
rather than being assumed globally.  See `strongDuality` below.

## Parameters, not logarithms

Claim 16 of the source fixes `ε := ln(1+δ)/⌈log_{3/4} δ⌉` and `k := ⌈log_{3/4} δ⌉`,
and then needs `ε ≤ 1/4`, `(3/4)^k ≤ δ` and `(1+ε)^k ≤ 1+δ`.  Only those three
inequalities are used.  Stating the claim with `ε`, `k`, `δ` *related by those
inequalities* rather than by the closed form is both more general and free of
`Real.log` numerics, and it is the same discipline `Imported.lean` applies to the
paper's `Õ`/`Ω̃`.  `exists_powering_params` then exhibits a valid triple, so the
generality is not vacuous.

/-! ## Conical juntas

A non-negative combination of width-`d` conjunctions.

The definition is **inductive** rather than an existential over a list of
weighted terms.  The two are the same predicate — a finite non-negative
combination is built from single terms by repeated addition — but the inductive
form pays off twice over.  Closure under the operations the argument needs
(scaling, products, powers) becomes a structural induction instead of surgery on
lists; and the one fact everything is *consumed* through, that a certificate
sends a conical junta to something non-positive, is a three-case induction
rather than an exchange of a `Finset` sum with a `List` sum.

`congr` is a constructor rather than a derived lemma so that the predicate is
extensional: `add` produces the literal function `fun α => f α + g α`, and
without `congr` every use would have to match that syntactic shape. -/

/-- **The converse of `const`: a conical `0`-junta *is* a constant.**

Width `0` forces a conjunction to be empty (`Term.width` is the literal count),
and the empty conjunction is satisfied by every assignment, so the only
generators available at degree `0` are the non-negative constants — and constants
are closed under the sums and rescalings the inductive predicate allows.

Stated as `d = 0 → …` rather than with `0` in the index so that the induction may
be performed directly; `isConst_of_zero` is the form to use.

This is what puts a floor under `deg⁺`: at degree `0` a `δ`-approximation of a
`{0,1}`-valued function must approximate *both* of its values by one number, so
no non-constant function is `δ`-approximable at degree `0` for `δ < 1/2`.  It is
the fact `Imported.hardnessOfNegation_witness` runs on. -/

/-! ## Splitting a conjunction across a doubled variable set

The source's Claim 15 doubles the variables — `f^∨(xy) := f(x) ∨ f(y)` — and its
step 2 uses that a conjunction on the doubled set *factors*, `C(x,y) = C₁(x)C₂(y)`.
That is the property a junta would not have, and the reason this file's primitive
is the conjunction; see the module docstring.

The doubled variable type is `V ⊕ V`, so an assignment `β` restricts to
`β ∘ Sum.inl` and `β ∘ Sum.inr`.  `leftPart` and `rightPart` are built by
*selecting* from `Finset.univ` rather than by mapping out of `t`, which avoids
inverting `Sum.inl` and needs only the `Fintype V` already in scope. -/

/-! ## Claim 15: `∨` is at least as hard as `2 − f`

[GKY22, §3], Claim `negp_to_or`.  Given a certificate for
`2 − f`, the *negated tensor product* `Φ^∨(x,y) := −Φ(x)Φ(y)` is a certificate
for `f^∨`, with the margin squared.  The source calls the construction "an
educated guess"; what makes it work is that the dual constraints are closed under
products of *non-positive* numbers, which is exactly where the minus sign earns
its place. -/

/-- The arithmetic `∨` of `f` with itself on the doubled variable set:
`f(x) + f(y) − f(x)f(y)`.  For `{0,1}`-valued `f` this is the indicator of
`f(x) ∨ f(y)` (`orExt_eq_or`), but the certificate argument never needs that. -/

/-- **`cl: or`, the easy half** ([GKY22, `cl:or`]): the
doubled disjunction `f^∨` of a `{0,1}`-valued `f` is `1/4`-approximated by a
conical junta of the *same* degree as `f`, so `deg⁺_{1/4}(f^∨) ≤ deg⁺(f)`.

The approximator is `g(x,y) = (f(x)+f(y))/2 + 1/4`, taking the values
`1/4, 3/4, 5/4` and sitting exactly `1/4` from `f^∨` in every case.  This is the
nonnegative-*degree* twin of the nonnegative-*rank* statement
`Automata.ErrorReduction.hasApproxNNRankLE_orExtend`, and it is literally the same
proof: two pullbacks (`IsConical.comp` along `Sum.inl` / `Sum.inr`), a scaling by
`1/2` (`IsConical.smul`) and the constant `1/4` (`IsConical.const`), assembled by
`IsConical.add`.  It is the degree form of `cl: or` that
`Automata/ErrorReduction.lean` deliberately does not carry, since it belongs on
the conical-junta side. -/

/-! ## Claim 16: the powering trick

[GKY22, §3], Claim `neg_to_negp`.  A conical junta
`ε`-approximating `1 + f` is turned into one `δ`-approximating `f` by
`g' := ((g + ε)/2)^k`: the shift and halving send the `f = 0` branch into
`[0, 3/4]` and the `f = 1` branch into `[1, 1+ε]`, and raising to the `k`-th
power then pushes the first branch down to `δ` while moving the second by at
most `δ`.

The source fixes `ε := ln(1+δ)/⌈log_{3/4} δ⌉` and `k := ⌈log_{3/4} δ⌉`, but its
proof uses only the three inequalities `ε ≤ 1/4`, `(3/4)^k ≤ δ` and
`(1+ε)^k ≤ 1+δ`.  Taking those as the hypotheses is more general, keeps
`Real.log` out of the statement, and matches how this development treats the
paper's asymptotics elsewhere.  `exists_powering_params` supplies a valid
triple. -/

/-! ## Strong duality

The converse of `Separates.not_hasConicalApprox`: if no conical `d`-junta
`ε`-approximates `f`, a certificate exists.  The source invokes this in one
clause — "by strong LP duality, `deg⁺_δ(f) > d` iff there exists a feasible
solution `Φ`" — and it is what lets Claims 15 and 16, which live on opposite
sides of the LP, be composed into Lemma 14.

**It is proved here, not assumed.**  The usual route is Farkas, which needs a
finitely generated cone to be closed, and Mathlib has no theory of polyhedral
cones.  That route is unnecessary: the *other* set in the separation is a ball in
the sup norm, which is **open**, and `geometric_hahn_banach_open` asks for
openness of only one of the two sets.  So the cone needs to be convex and
nothing more.

The price is a margin that shrinks by an arbitrarily small amount: the conclusion
is a certificate at any `ε' < ε`, not at `ε` itself.  That is exactly the
boundary that openness gives up, and it costs nothing downstream, where every
constant has slack. -/

/-- **Strong duality.**  No `ε`-approximation by conical `d`-juntas yields a
certificate with any margin below `ε`.

The separating functional is turned into a certificate in three steps.  It is
non-negative on the cone because the cone is closed under positive scaling and
`0` lies in it, which pins the separating constant `u` to `u ≤ 0`.  Its `ℓ¹`
norm is positive because otherwise the functional would vanish, contradicting
`Φ f < u ≤ 0`.  And evaluating it at the point `f + ε'·sign(ψ)` of the ball —
the worst point for `Φ`, which is what makes `ε'` appear — gives the margin. -/

/-! ## Lemma 14: `∨` is at least as hard as `¬`

[GKY22, §3], Lemma `neg_to_or`.  Claims 15 and 16 composed
across the LP, which is what strong duality above makes possible.

The source states it as `deg⁺_{ε²}(f^∨) ≥ Ω(deg⁺_δ(¬f))` with
`ε = ln(1+δ)/⌈log_{3/4} δ⌉`.  Here the parameters stay explicit and the `Ω` is
the factor `k`: from "no conical `(k·d)`-junta `δ`-approximates `¬f`" one gets
"no conical `d`-junta `ε''`-approximates `f^∨`" for every `ε'' ≤ ε'²` with
`ε' < ε`. -/

/-- **Lemma 14 of the source.**  Hardness of negating `f` transfers to hardness
of the doubled disjunction `f^∨`, with the degree divided by `k` and the error
squared.

Reading the proof forwards: Claim 16 turns the hypothesis into a statement about
`1 + ¬f = 2 − f`; strong duality turns that into a certificate; Claim 15 turns
that certificate into one for `f^∨`; and weak duality turns *that* back into a
non-approximability statement. -/
