# A witness for the parameters of `thm: main`

`Separation.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` is stated for *any* parameters `ι, m, F, Zι`
satisfying four conditions: an injection `e : ι × Fin m → F`, an injection
`rep : F × F → (Zι → Bool)`, `6|ι| < m`, and `8|Zι| ≤ |F|`.  This file exhibits parameters
that satisfy all four, for every `n = |ι|`, and applies `thm: main` to them.

The point is vacuity.  A theorem whose hypotheses have no model is a theorem about
nothing, and `#print axioms` cannot tell the difference.  Until the four conditions are
jointly realized in Lean, `Separation.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` is a conditional that
might be conditional on the impossible; after this file it is a conditional on
`Imported.FixedPartitionHard` alone (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §6, gap G6).

## The choice, and why it is forced

The paper ([VS24, §4.4.2]) works over `F` of order `n' = 2ᵗ` and
represents a member of `𝒫 ⊆ F × F` by `2t` bits.  Reading its constraints back:

* `rep` injective needs `|F|² ≤ 2^{|Zι|}`, i.e. `2^{2t} ≤ 2^{|Zι|}`.  Taking `|Zι| = 2t`
  makes this an equality — the paper's own bit count, and the tightest choice available.
* `8|Zι| ≤ |F|` then reads `16t ≤ 2ᵗ`, which fails at `t = 6` (`96 > 64`) and holds for
  every `t ≥ 7` (`112 ≤ 128`).  This is `sixteen_mul_le_two_pow`, and `t ≥ 7` is sharp.
* `6|ι| < m` is satisfied by the smallest legal `m`, namely `m = 6n + 1`.
* `e` injective needs `n·m ≤ |F|`, i.e. `n(6n+1) ≤ 2ᵗ`.

So the only real constraint on `t` is `t ≥ 7` together with `2ᵗ ≥ n(6n+1)`, and we take
`t = 7 + ⌈log₂(n(6n+1))⌉` (`Nat.clog`), the least such value up to the `+7`.

**`t` has to be logarithmic, not merely large enough.**  Any `t ≥ 7` with `2ᵗ ≥ nm` makes
all four hypotheses true, so for the bare purpose of non-vacuity `t = 7 + nm` would do and
would be a one-line proof.  It would also be useless.  The upper bound of
`Separation.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` carries the factor `|𝒫| = (|F| − 1)|F| ≈ 2^{2t}`,
and the paper's own count for that factor is the `n^{k+4}` of `thm: fixed_to_best`
([VS24, §4.2]), whose `n⁴` is `|F|²` *because* `|F| = O(n²)`.  With `t` linear
in `nm` that factor becomes `2^{Θ(n²)}`, the d-SDNNF upper bound stops being `2^{Õ(k)}`,
and the comparison the theorem exists to make collapses.  `card_Fld_le` records the polynomial bound
`|F| ≤ 256·n(6n+1)` that the logarithmic choice buys.

## `GaloisField` and its missing instances

For the field itself Mathlib supplies `GaloisField 2 t`, with `GaloisField.card` giving
`Nat.card (GaloisField p n) = p ^ n` for `n ≠ 0`.  It carries `Finite` but **not**
`Fintype`, and no `DecidableEq`, while `Separation.lean` asks for both.  Both are
supplied here noncomputably (`Fintype.ofFinite`, `Classical.decEq`); this costs nothing,
since `Fintype` is a subsingleton — so `Fintype.card` is independent of which instance is
found — and the whole area is about existence of circuits, never about computing them.

## The shape of the conclusion

`Instance.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` is `Separation.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` with
every parameter discharged and every bound written out in numerals: the d-SDNNF upper bound
becomes

  `(2ᵗ − 1)·2ᵗ·(termBound·(6n+1)ᵏ)·(2(2t + k(6n+1)) + 2) + 1`,

using `AffinePerms.card_maps` for `|𝒫| = (|F| − 1)|F|`.  Nothing here is asymptotic: the
two displayed numbers are what the paper compares, and comparing them is the last step
(`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5).

## What the asymptotic packaging would still need

`card_maps_Fld_le` supplies the missing size ingredient — the leading factor is
`O(n⁴)`, so the d-SDNNF bound is `termBound·mᵏ·poly(n)` — and with it the paper's final
line, `2^{Ω̃(k²)} = n^{Ω̃(log n)}`, is arithmetic on two explicit numbers.  It is *not*
derivable from what is in the library, and the obstacle is not this file.  The paper's
`n = k^{O(1)}` and `termBound = 2^{Õ(k)}` and `coverBound = 2^{Ω̃(k²)}` are properties of
`Imported.FixedPartitionHard` *as a family indexed by `k`*, and the bundle is stated for
one `k` at a time with `termBound` and `coverBound` free.  Packaging the asymptotics
therefore means a family version of that bundle carrying the three tilde bounds, which is
a change to `Imported.lean` and a definition of `Õ`/`Ω̃` — precisely the "substantial
development in its own right, consumed exactly once" that `Imported.lean`'s own docstring
declines.  Nothing in this file blocks it; it is simply a different piece of work.

/-! ## The arithmetic

Two facts, both about `2ᵗ`.  The first is the only one with any content: `16t ≤ 2ᵗ` is
false below `t = 7` and true from `t = 7` on, and the induction step needs the base case
to have already put `2ᵗ` above `16`. -/

overshooting and `2⁷` from the `16t ≤ 2ᵗ` constraint; the paper suppresses both.

Stated over the concrete `Fld n`/`Zid n` rather than with `t` existentially quantified,

Identical to `Separation.exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` except that `ι`, `m`, `F`, `Zι` are
now the concrete choices above and all four side conditions have been proved, so the *only*
remaining hypothesis is the imported fixed-partition hardness.  Both bounds are numerals in
`n`, `k` and `termBound`:

* upper: `(2ᵗ − 1)·2ᵗ·(termBound·(6n+1)ᵏ)·(2(2t + k(6n+1)) + 2) + 1`, with
  `(2ᵗ − 1)·2ᵗ = |𝒫|` by `AffinePerms.card_maps`;

  the chain weakens it. -/

The same discharge again, on the disjunction theorem.  The parameters are shared
with `exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation` — the copy count `6n+1`, the field `Fld n` and the
identifier set `Zid n` do not depend on *which* hardness result is being lifted,
only on `n` — so `exists_e`, `exists_rep` and the two cardinality side conditions
are reused verbatim.  The single remaining hypothesis is `UnionHard`.

The size bound is the same numeral as in `exists_dSDNNF_hard_negation`, and that is not a
coincidence: both come from compiling a lifted `k`-DNF with `termBound` terms
through the same compiler.  Here it is asserted of *both* `ψ'` and `φ'`, against
one prescribed v-tree. -/

The arithmetic corollary at the same concrete parameters as the three Boolean
ones.  Nothing new is discharged here — `cor: add` is `thm: union` read through
`φ`, and `φ` does not touch the variable type — so the same `exists_e`,
`exists_rep` and cardinality facts serve, and the size bound is the same numeral
for the fourth time.

Clause (2) is the paper's: every dSD-`AC_p` for `f + g` is large.  It is
