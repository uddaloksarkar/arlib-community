# Pulling rectangle covers back along a substitution

The mechanism behind the proof of `thm: fixed_to_best`
([VS24, §4.5]), isolated from the particular substitution the paper
uses so that it can be stated once and reused.

## What the paper does, and what it really needs

The paper argues in the language of *protocols*: given a non-deterministic
protocol for `ψ'` under a partition `Γ`, it builds one for `ψ` under `Π` by
running the first protocol on a transformed input (lines 452–457).  Since we
never formalize protocols — every measure here is a rectangle count, see
inventory D20 and Part E — the same content has to be expressed on rectangles.

It comes out cleaner.  A protocol simulation is exactly a **pullback of a
rectangle cover along a substitution**: if `ρ` transforms `Π`-assignments into
`Γ`-assignments in a way that respects the two partitions block-by-block, then
every `Γ`-rectangle pulls back to a `Π`-rectangle, covers pull back to covers of
the same size, and partitions to partitions.  No protocol ever appears, and the
size bound is preserved on the nose rather than through a `log`/`exp` round trip.

## The one condition that matters

`PartitionMap` below is the whole hypothesis: the `Γ.X`-part of `ρ α` may depend
only on the `Π.X`-part of `α`, and likewise on the right.  That is precisely
what the paper's substitution achieves — Alice's variables are built from
Alice's variables — and it is what makes the pulled-back predicate local to its
own side, hence a rectangle.

Note the direction: covers of `f` pull back to covers of `f ∘ ρ`, so a **lower**
bound on the cover number of the *substituted* function gives a lower bound on
the original.  That is the direction `thm: fixed_to_best` needs, and it is why
the theorem reads `NCC_δ(ψ') ≥ NCC_δ^Π(ψ)` rather than the other way round.

/-- **A substitution compatible with two partitions.**

`toFun` turns an assignment to `V` into one to `W`, and does so *block-wise*:
the values it produces on `Q.X` are determined by the values it was given on
`P.X`, and likewise for `Y`.

This is the abstraction of the substitution in the proof of `thm: fixed_to_best`
([VS24, §4.5]), where each original variable `xᵢ` is routed to a
copy that the chosen permutation places on the *same side* of the partition —
which is exactly what Claim `perm` is there to guarantee. -/

Locality is what has to be checked, and it is exactly what `PartitionMap`
supplies: two source assignments agreeing on `P.X` have images agreeing on
`Q.X`, so the left predicate cannot tell them apart. -/

/-! ## The consequence for the measures

The form in which the lifting theorem consumes all of this: a **lower** bound on
the substituted function's cover number transfers to the original. -/

/-- `Cov_b^Π(g) ≤ Cov_b^Γ(f)` when `g = f ∘ ρ`.

Contrapositively — and this is how it is used — if `g` needs many rectangles
under `Π`, then `f` needs at least as many under `Γ`.  Applied with `Γ` ranging
over *all* balanced partitions of the substituted variables, that is exactly
`thm: fixed_to_best`.

**`Coverable` is not removable.** `fixedCov` is an `sInf` over `ℕ`, so when `f`
admits no finite cover at all the right-hand side is the junk value `0` and the
inequality would assert `Cov_b^Π(g) = 0`, which is false in general.  The
hypothesis is discharged for every function the paper considers by
`coverable_of_dependsOn`. -/
