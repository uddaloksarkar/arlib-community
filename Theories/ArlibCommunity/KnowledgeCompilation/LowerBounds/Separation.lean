# The separation theorems

`thm: main` ([VS24], proof at [VS24, §4.2]) and `thm: sep`
([VS24, `thm: sep`], proof at [VS24, §4.5]): the assembly of everything else in
the area into the statement that **structured d-DNNF is not closed under
negation**, and its consequence that d-SDNNF is strictly more succinct than SDD.

## What the statements look like, and why

The paper reads *"for every `n` there is an `f` with a d-SDNNF of size `n` such
that every structured DNNF for `¬f` has size `n^{Ω̃(log n)}`"*.  Every quantity in
that sentence is asymptotic, and all of them come from one place: the constants
of the imported fixed-partition hardness (`Imported.FixedPartitionHard`).  So
the theorems below take that bundle as a hypothesis, with its `termBound` and
`coverBound` as parameters, and conclude with **both** bounds explicit:

* an upper bound `|C| ≤ |𝒫|·(termBound·m^k)·(2(|Z| + km) + 2) + 1` on a d-SDNNF
  for `f`, and
* a lower bound `coverBound ≤ |C|` on every structured DNNF for `¬f`.

This is `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5 carried to the end of the chain: *given hardness with
these constants, the separation has those constants*.  Instantiating `k`,
`m = 6n+1`, `|F| = 2^t` and `termBound = 2^{Õ(k)}` recovers the paper's
`n^{Ω̃(log n)}` by arithmetic on the two displayed numbers, and that arithmetic
is the only asymptotic content anywhere in the area.

## The shape of the argument

`f` is `ψ'`, the copy-and-permute lifting of the hard `ψ` (`LowerBounds/Lifting.lean`).

*Upper bound.*  `ψ'` is an unambiguous `(|Z| + km)`-DNF with at most
`|𝒫|·termBound·m^k` terms, so `exists_isdSDNNF_of_unambiguous_kDNF` compiles it
into a d-SDNNF respecting *any* prescribed v-tree.  Unambiguity is the only
property of `ψ'` used, and it is where the canonical choice-function enumeration
of `Lifting.lean` earns its keep.

*Lower bound.*  A structured DNNF for `¬ψ'` yields, by the rectangle lemma, a
cover of `ψ'⁻¹(0)` by `|C|` rectangles for the *balanced* partition cut out of
its own v-tree.  The lifting theorem pulls that cover back to a cover of
`ψ⁻¹(0)` of the same size for the hard partition `Π`, which the imported
hardness forbids below `coverBound`.  Note where the quantifiers go: the
circuit chooses the v-tree and hence the partition, and the lifting theorem must
survive *every* balanced choice — that is exactly the best-partition difficulty
the whole construction exists to overcome.

## `var(T) = var(ψ')`: needed by the machinery, not by the statement

The paper's `def: vtree` ([VS24]) makes a v-tree a v-tree
*for the variable set of the function*, so `var(T) = var(ψ')` is built into its
notation and never appears as a hypothesis.  Here `Respects` relates a circuit
to an *arbitrary* tree, and the machinery does need the equality: the rectangle
lemma produces a partition of `var(T)`, while Claim `perm` needs a partition of
all of `var(ψ')` (its cardinality bounds are about `|F|`).

The lower bounds nonetheless do not assume it.  `Respects` is monotone in the
v-tree — a node of `T` is still a node of any tree containing `T`, so the
witness supplied for each `∧`-node survives — and every well-formed `T` embeds
in a well-formed tree over all of `var(ψ')`, obtained by hanging a v-tree over
the omitted variables beside it (`VTree.exists_wellFormed_isSubtree`, packaged
with monotonicity as `NNF.Respects.exists_graft`).  So the general case reduces
to the spanning one in one step, and a circuit structured by a v-tree that
omits variables of `ψ'` *is* covered.

The *upper* bound keeps `T.vars = univ`, and there it is a feature rather than a
hypothesis to be removed: the v-tree there is **prescribed** — the theorem
builds a d-SDNNF respecting whichever v-tree over `var(ψ')` the reader names —
and a prescribed tree that failed to mention some variable would leave the
statement silent about it.

`NCC₀(f) ≥ NCC₀^Π(g)` ([VS24, §4.2]).

The hypothesis is the junk-value guard of `Arlib/Communication/Measures.lean`: `bestCov`
is an `sInf` over the balanced partitions, so if there were no balanced partition
of `var(ψ')` at all it would be `0` and no lower bound could hold.  One balanced
partition is all that is needed, and the rectangle lemma supplies one in the
application (`coverBound_le_size_of_computes_not` therefore does not use this
statement, and needs no such hypothesis). -/

/-- **The lower-bound half of `thm: main`**: every structured DNNF computing
`¬ψ'` has size at least `coverBound`.

This is the composition the whole area is built for.  Reading the proof
backwards: the imported hardness forbids a `Π`-cover of `ψ⁻¹(0)` below
`coverBound`; the lifting theorem manufactures one from any `Γ`-cover of
`ψ'⁻¹(0)`, for `Γ` balanced; the rectangle lemma manufactures such a `Γ` and
such a cover, of size `|C|`, from the circuit.  Determinism is not needed — the
cover half of the rectangle lemma suffices, which is why the statement is about
structured DNNF and not only about d-SDNNF.

The v-tree is arbitrary: it is *not* assumed to mention every variable of `ψ'`,
even though the machinery downstream needs a partition of all of them.  The
first step of the proof repairs that by grafting the missing variables onto `T`
(`NNF.Respects.exists_graft`), which `C` still respects; see the module
docstring. -/

/-- **`thm: main`** ([VS24]): *there is a Boolean function
with a small structured d-DNNF whose negation has no small structured DNNF*,
with both bounds explicit.

The function is `ψ'`, the copy-and-permute lifting of the hard `k`-DNF supplied
by the imported fixed-partition hardness.  Everything is conditional on that
hardness and on nothing else: `#print axioms` reports only the three standard
ones, and the hypothesis is a parameter rather than an axiom precisely so that
this statement says something (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3).

The two bounds, side by side:

* **upper** `|C| ≤ |𝒫|·(termBound·m^k)·(2(|Zι| + km) + 2) + 1`, for a d-SDNNF
  respecting any prescribed v-tree over `var(ψ')`;
* **lower** `coverBound ≤ |C|`, for every structured DNNF computing `¬ψ'`.

The paper's `n^{Ω̃(log n)}` is the comparison of these two numbers under its
choice of parameters; see the module docstring. -/

The paper's proof is two sentences: complement the SDD, and apply `thm: main`.
Both steps are here — the complementation as the imported bundle
`Imported.SDDComplementation`, whose polynomial is the explicit `c·|C|^d`, and
`thm: main` as `coverBound_le_size_of_computes_not`.

The conclusion is stated as `coverBound ≤ c·|C|^d` rather than as a bound on
`|C|` itself, because extracting `|C|` would mean a `d`-th root in `ℕ` and a
rounding convention chosen for no reason: the inequality as displayed is exactly
what the argument gives, and any instantiation can take the root itself. -/
