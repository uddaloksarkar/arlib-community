# Step 1 of the lifting: making copies of variables

The first half of the copy-and-permute construction (paper §4.4.1,
[VS24, §4.4.1]).  Every variable `xᵢ` of the original formula is
replaced by a disjunction `⋁_{j ∈ [m]} y_{i,j}` of `m` fresh copies, the result
is expanded by distributivity into a DNF, and then — a step Knop does not need,
but this paper does — each term is *re-disambiguated* by adding `¬y_{i,j'}` for
every copy `j'` other than the one it selected.

Copies are indexed by `ι × Fin m`: the copy `y_{i,j}` is the variable `(i, j)`.

## The shape of a derived term

The paper computes (line 413) that every term of `ψ^∨` derived from a term with
positive part `I_p` and negative part `I_n` has the form

  `⋀_{i ∈ I_p} y_{i,jᵢ} ∧ ⋀_{i ∈ I_p, j ≠ jᵢ} ¬y_{i,j} ∧ ⋀_{i ∈ I_n} ⋀_j ¬y_{i,j}`

so such a term is determined by the original term together with a *choice
function* `c : ι → Fin m` picking, for each positive variable, which copy is
switched on.  `copyTerm` below is exactly this, and the two `biUnion`s are the
positive and negative parts of the display.

## The trap: this is not a semantics-preserving construction

It is very natural to expect `ψ^∨ ≡ ψ[xᵢ := ⋁ⱼ y_{i,j}]`, and **that is false**.
The intermediate DNF `φ`, before re-disambiguation, does satisfy it; adding the
`¬y_{i,j'}` conjuncts at line 385 strictly shrinks the satisfying set.  An
assignment switching on *two* copies of some `xᵢ` satisfies `φ` — it satisfies
whichever term chose either copy — but satisfies no term of `ψ^∨` at all, since
every one of them forces the other copies off.

The paper never claims the equivalence: its lemma at line 391 asserts only
unambiguity, the width, and the term count.  But a formalization that stated the
equivalence unconditionally would be wrong.

What is true, and what the lifting actually consumes, is the pair below:

* `sat_of_sat_copyTerm` — **soundness**, unconditional.  If `α` satisfies a
  derived term, then the collapsed assignment satisfies the original.
* `exists_copyTerm_sat` — **completeness**, conditional on `α` being *one-hot*:
  at most one copy of each variable is on.

And this is precisely why the protocol in the proof of `thm: fixed_to_best`
(lines 452–457) sets *every other variable of `V` to zero*.  That clause is not
padding; it is what places the simulated input in the region where `ψ^∨` and `ψ`
agree, and without it the reduction would not be sound.

choice function that selects, for each variable, the copy that `α` switches on.

The one-hot hypothesis is not removable: an `α` switching on two copies of some
positively-occurring `xᵢ` collapses to a satisfying assignment of `t`, yet
satisfies no derived term whatsoever, because each of them switches the other
copies off.  See the module docstring. -/

/-! ## Towards unambiguity -/

/-- **A satisfied derived term determines its choice function.**

If `α` satisfies the terms derived from `t` by two choice functions, those
functions agree wherever it matters — on the positive part of `t`, which is the
only place `copyTerm` reads them.

This is the crux of the paper's unambiguity argument (line 415, "it is therefore
easy to see that `C = C'`"): a term of `ψ^∨` derived from `t` is *determined* by
its choice function, so two satisfied ones must coincide.  Note that no one-hot
hypothesis is needed — the derived term supplies its own, since it explicitly
switches every unselected copy off. -/

/-! ## Assembling `ψ^∨`

The DNF of the construction: one derived term per original term and per choice
function.  The enumeration of choice functions is a *parameter* rather than
being fixed here, and that is deliberate — see the discussion below. -/

/-- **`ψ^∨`** (paper §4.4.1, [VS24]), relative to a supplied
enumeration `choices t` of the choice functions to use for the term `t`.

Fixing the enumeration inside this definition would mean committing to a
concrete listing of the functions `posPart t → Fin m`, which in Lean means
`Finset.pi` plus a total extension.  That machinery has nothing to do with the
mathematics: `copyTerm t c` depends on `c` only through its restriction to
`posPart t` (`copyTerm_congr`), so *any* enumeration hitting every restriction
gives the same DNF up to the order and multiplicity of its terms.  Taking it as a
parameter keeps the two concerns apart, and lets the term count below be stated
against whatever bound the enumeration achieves — the paper's `m^k` per term
being the case where `choices t` enumerates `posPart t → Fin m` exactly once
each. -/

/-- **Unambiguity of `ψ^∨`, in pairwise form** (paper's lemma at
[VS24, §4.4.1]).

Two derived terms satisfied by the same assignment are *equal*.  The argument is
the paper's: collapse `α`, use unambiguity of `ψ` to see both came from the same
original term, then `copyTerm_eq_of_sat` to see the choice functions agree where
it matters.

This is the pairwise statement (`Unambiguous.eq_of_sat`-shaped), not the counting
one that `DNF.Unambiguous` asks for.  Upgrading it needs the enumeration
`choices t` to be *irredundant* — to list no restriction to `posPart t` twice —
which is a property of the enumeration rather than of the construction, and is
exactly the multiplicity issue that motivated making `DNF` a `List`.  See the
module docstring of `Circuits/DNF.lean`. -/
