# The Wegman–Carter family of affine permutations

Import **I3** of the area (`lem: indperm`, [VS24]), attributed
to Wegman–Carter — and, unlike the fixed-partition hardness, entirely within
reach.  This file discharges it, so it is no longer an import.

Over a finite field `F`, the maps `x ↦ a·x + b` with `a ≠ 0` form a set `𝒫` of
`(|F| − 1)·|F|` permutations which is *pairwise independent*: for any two
distinct points `a ≠ b` and any two distinct targets `c ≠ d`, exactly one member
of `𝒫` sends `a ↦ c` and `b ↦ d`.  The paper uses this with `|F| = n' = 2ᵗ` to
get a small family of permutations of the copy-variables that is nevertheless
rich enough for the probabilistic argument of Claim `perm`.

## Counting, not probability

The paper phrases the conclusion as `Pr_{σ ∈ 𝒫}[σ(a) = c, σ(b) = d] = 1/|𝒫|`.
We prove the sharper and more basic statement it rests on — that there is
**exactly one** such `σ` (`existsUnique_affine`) — and derive the count
(`card_filter_maps_eq_one`).  The probability is then immediate for any uniform
measure on `𝒫`, and stating it as a count keeps the file free of a probability
space it does not need.  This also makes the result usable by a counting
argument directly, which is how Claim `perm`'s second-moment computation will
want it.

The proof is one line of algebra: `σ(a) = c` and `σ(b) = d` force
`α·(a − b) = c − d`, so `α = (c − d)/(a − b)`, which is nonzero exactly because
`c ≠ d`, and then `β = c − α·a` is determined.  The hypothesis `a ≠ b` is what
makes the division legal, and `c ≠ d` is what keeps the result in `𝒫` rather
than degenerating to a constant map.

/-- **The interpolation fact.**  Given two distinct points and two distinct
targets, exactly one affine permutation carries the one pair to the other.

This is the whole content of `lem: indperm`.  Both hypotheses are needed and for
different reasons: `a ≠ b` makes the division legal, and `c ≠ d` is what forces
the resulting leading coefficient to be nonzero — without it the unique affine
*map* would be a constant, which is not a permutation and so not in `𝒫`. -/
