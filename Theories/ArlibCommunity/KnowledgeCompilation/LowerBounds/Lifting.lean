# Step 2 of the lifting: adding permutations

The second half of the copy-and-permute construction (paper §4.4.2,
[VS24, §4.4.2]), and the lifting theorem it exists for
(`thm: fixed_to_best`, [VS24]; proof at [VS24, §4.5]).

Step 1 (`LowerBounds/Copies.lean`) replaced each variable by `m` copies.  Step 2
takes the resulting `ψ^∨`, whose variables are identified with the elements of a
finite field `F`, and forms

  `ψ' := ⋁_{σ ∈ 𝒫} ⋁_{C ∈ ψ^∨} perm_σ(C)`,
  `perm_σ(C) := ⋀_{i} (zᵢ = rep(σ)ᵢ) ∧ ⋀_{i ∈ I} a_{σ(i)}`

where `𝒫` is the Wegman–Carter family of `LowerBounds/AffinePerms.lean` and the
fresh `z`-variables record *which* permutation a term was built from.

## Four design decisions

**The variables of `ψ'` are `F ⊕ Zι`.**  A sum type, not an injection of two
families into one index type.  The left summand is the paper's `V = var(ψ^∨)`,
identified with the field ([VS24, §4.4.2]: `y_{i,j} := v_{im+j}`,
`n' = |F|`); the right summand is the `z`-block.  With a sum, "the `z`-block
mentions no `V`-variable" is `Sum.inl ≠ Sum.inr` and needs no hypothesis, and a
partition of `var(ψ')` splits into its `V`-part and its `Z`-part by
`Finset.filter` with no disjointness side conditions.  An injection into one
index type would put a disjointness hypothesis into every statement below, and
the cardinality bookkeeping of `Separation.lean` — which is where balancedness
of `Γ` is converted into a hypothesis of Claim `perm` — would become an argument
about images rather than about `Fintype.card`.

**`rep` is a parameter, not a construction.**  The paper represents `σ ∈ 𝒫` by
`2t` bits, having assumed `n' = |F| = 2^t` so that `𝒫 ⊆ F × F` is a set of
`2t`-bit strings ([VS24, `lem: indperm`]).  Nothing in the argument uses
anything about that encoding except that it is **injective on `𝒫`**: injectivity
is what makes distinct `σ` give disjoint terms, and the width of the `z`-block is
just `|Zι|`.  So `Zι` is an arbitrary finite index type and `rep : F × F →
(Zι → Bool)` is a parameter with an injectivity hypothesis, and
`exists_rep_injective` below produces one whenever `|F|² ≤ 2^{|Zι|}` — which for
`|F| = 2^t` is exactly `|Zι| = 2t`, the paper's own count.  This is also why the
`n' = 2^t` assumption (gap G3) never appears: the field is arbitrary, and the
representation length is a parameter rather than a consequence.

**The permutations are `(maps F).toList`, fixed inside the definition.**  Unlike
the choice functions of Step 1, there is nothing to be gained from making the
enumeration of `𝒫` a parameter: it is a `Finset`, its `toList` is duplicate-free,
and duplicate-freeness is exactly what the counting form of unambiguity needs.

**The choice functions of Step 1 are enumerated here, canonically.**
`Copies.copyDNF` takes the enumeration as a parameter and proves unambiguity in
*pairwise* form only, because the counting form `DNF.Unambiguous` additionally
forbids a satisfiable term from being listed twice — a property of the
enumeration rather than of the construction (see the docstring of
`Copies.copyDNF_eq_of_sat`).  `canonChoices` is an enumeration that has it: the
functions constant `0` outside `posPart t`, listed once each.  With it, Step 1's
pairwise unambiguity upgrades to the counting form (`unambiguous_copiesDNF`),
which is what the d-SDNNF upper bound of `Circuits/DNFtoCircuit.lean` consumes.

## Unambiguity is a statement about lists

Both halves of the construction are a `List.flatMap`, and in both the counting
form of unambiguity comes from the same shape: *at most one outer element
contributes, and it contributes at most one term*.  For Step 1 the outer list is
`ψ` and "at most one contributes" is unambiguity of `ψ`; for Step 2 it is `𝒫` and
"at most one contributes" is injectivity of `rep`.  `length_filter_flatMap_le`
is that argument, once, with the two instances differing only in the selector
`q`.

/-! ## A canonical enumeration of the choice functions of Step 1

`Copies.copyDNF` is parameterised by an enumeration `choices t` of the choice
functions to use for the term `t`, because `copyTerm t c` depends on `c` only
through its restriction to `posPart t` and fixing a listing inside the
definition would mix the mathematics with `Finset.pi`.  Here is the listing,
and it is chosen to be **irredundant**: exactly one representative of each
restriction, namely the one that is `0` outside `posPart t`.

That is precisely the missing ingredient of Step 1.  Pairwise unambiguity —
"two satisfied derived terms are equal" — is `Copies.copyDNF_eq_of_sat` and holds
for any enumeration; the counting form `DNF.Unambiguous`, which is what the
d-SDNNF construction consumes, additionally forbids listing a satisfiable term
twice, and that fails for a redundant enumeration. -/

/-! ## The representation of a permutation exists

`rep` is a parameter above, with injectivity on `𝒫` its only requirement.  It is
worth knowing that the requirement is satisfiable, and with the paper's own
number of bits: for `|F| = 2^t` the hypothesis below reads `2^{2t} ≤ 2^{|Zι|}`,
i.e. `|Zι| = 2t` suffices — the paper's `2t`-bit strings
([VS24, `lem: indperm`]), recovered rather than assumed. -/

/-! ## `thm: fixed_to_best`

The lifting theorem ([VS24, `thm: fixed_to_best`], proof at [VS24, §4.5]).  The paper
argues by simulating a protocol; we build the substitution the simulation is,
and hand it to `LowerBounds/Pullback.lean`.  See that file's docstring for why
the rectangle formulation is the honest one.

The whole content is `exists_partitionMap_permDNF`: **for every balanced `Γ` of
`var(ψ')` there is a substitution, compatible with `Π` and `Γ` block by block,
under which `ψ'` computes `ψ`.**  Everything the paper says about protocols for
`ψ'` and for `¬ψ'` is then a one-line corollary, the two cases differing only in
the Boolean `b` — which is why "the case for `¬ψ` is identical"
([VS24, §4.5]) really is identical here.

Two things about the hypotheses are worth flagging.

*`Π` need not be balanced.*  It is balanced in the application, because the
imported hardness delivers it so, but the pullback never looks at it.  Only `Γ`'s
balancedness is used, and only through Claim `perm`.

*`8·|Zι| ≤ |F|` is the price of the `z`-block.*  `Γ` is balanced on
`var(ψ') = V ∪ Z`, so its restriction to `V` is balanced only up to `|Z|`:
`|F| ≤ 3·|Γ_k ∩ V| + 2·|Z|`.  Claim `perm` is stated under `|F| ≤ 4·|Γ_k ∩ V|`
precisely so that this is enough, and the arithmetic closes exactly when
`8·|Z| ≤ |F|`.  For the paper's parameters, `|Z| = 2t` and `|F| = 2^t`, so it
holds for every `t ≥ 7`.  See `ClaimPerm`'s docstring and `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §6 G2. -/

/-- **The substitution of the proof of `thm: fixed_to_best`**
([VS24, §4.5]), and the fact that it is compatible with the two
partitions and turns `ψ'` into `ψ`.

The three clauses of the paper's protocol appear as the three clauses of the
definition of `ρ` inside the proof: the `z`-variables encode `σ`; the copy
`v_{r(i,k)}` that `σ` places on side `k` of `Γ` carries the value `aᵢ` of the
original variable, where `k` is the side of `Π` that `xᵢ` is on; and **every
other variable of `V` is zero**, which is what makes the simulated input one-hot
and hence puts it in the region where `ψ^∨` and `ψ` agree.

## One `ρ` for every formula at once

The conclusion quantifies over the DNF *inside* the existential: a single `ρ`
works simultaneously for **all** `χ`.  This is not a strengthening bought with
extra work — it is a reading of the construction.  Nothing that builds `ρ` ever
looks at a formula: the permutation `p` comes from Claim `perm`, which sees only
`e` and the two sides of `Γ`; the chosen copies `sel`/`site` see only `p` and
`P.X`.  The formula enters at the very last step, and only to be evaluated.

`thm: union` ([VS24]) is what needs this.  There the lifting
must be applied to `ψ` and `φ` *together* — the hardness is about `f ∪ g`, so
the same substitution has to convert `ψ' ∪ φ'` into `ψ ∪ φ` in one step.  Two
separate invocations would produce two unrelated `ρ`s, chosen from two
independent applications of Claim `perm`, and the union of the two conclusions
would say nothing about either union. -/
