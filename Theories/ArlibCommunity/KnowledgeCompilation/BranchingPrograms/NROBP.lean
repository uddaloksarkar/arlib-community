# Nondeterministic read-once branching programs, and Razgon's matching-width lower bound

The branching-program half of Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching
programs and CNFs of bounded treewidth* ([Raz16]): the
{\sc nrobp} model of its Definition 1 ([Raz16, `arosrn`]), the
notion of a `t`-node, the cut lemma `exists_split_isTNode` ([Raz16, `tnodecut`]),
and the lower bound `le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` ([Raz16, §4]).

Everything here is stated over a graph `G` on a finite vertex type `V`, whose vertices
double as the variables of the monotone 2-CNF `φ(G)`.  The vertex-cover vocabulary,
`φ(G)` itself, cross matchings and `MatchingWidthGe` all come from
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/BranchingPrograms/Basic.lean` and are not restated.

## The DAG encoding

Razgon's {\sc nrobp} is *a directed acyclic graph with one root, one leaf, possibly
multiple edges, and some edges labelled by literals*, such that no directed path carries
two literals of the same variable.  Following the house rule of this area
(`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.1, and the module docstring of
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/Circuits/NNF.lean`), the object is a **DAG, never a tree**:
nodes are the indices `Fin size`, and `size` — a node count — is the quantity the lower
bound is about.  An inductive tree would silently prove a weaker theorem, since unfolding
a shared subprogram can blow the node count up exponentially.

`NROBP.edge a b l` is a `Prop`-valued *ternary* relation: "there is an edge from `a` to
`b` labelled `l`", with `l : Option (Lit V)` — `none` for an unlabelled edge, `some (x, b)`
for the literal `x`/`¬x`.  Putting the label inside the relation rather than carrying an
edge-index type is the one modelling liberty taken with respect to the paper, and it is
worth being precise about what it costs.  Parallel edges with *different* labels are still
distinct, so the nondeterminism the model needs is present.  Parallel edges with the
*same* label are identified.  That is harmless here: every statement in this file speaks
only of the node count `size` and of the *lists of literals* carried by root-leaf paths,
and collapsing duplicate parallel edges changes neither.  (It does change the edge count,
which is why the paper's Definition-1 remark is careful to say that the lower bound of
Theorem 3 is measured in *nodes*.)

`edge_lt` — every edge goes from a smaller index to a larger — is the `child_lt` of
`Circuits/NNF.lean` turned around, and does the usual three jobs: acyclicity, a
topological order, and a termination measure.  Honesty requires flagging that *no proof
below uses it*: paths are an inductive family, so their finiteness is free, and the
argument never needs to order two nodes.  It is kept because a cyclic labelled graph is
not an {\sc nrobp}, and a reader must be able to see that from the definition.

## The path encoding

A root-leaf path is the single object the whole argument manipulates, and the four
operations it needs are: *read off the literals*, *split at a node*, *splice two paths
through a common node*, and *exclude a repeated variable*.  So paths are an inductive
family carrying exactly the literal list:

```
Path Z : Fin size → Fin size → List (Lit V) → Prop
```

with `skip` for an unlabelled edge (the list is unchanged) and `step` for a labelled one
(the literal is consed on).  `Path.append` is the splice, `Path.split` is the cut at a
prescribed literal-depth, and `ReadOnce` is a predicate on `Z` quantified over *all*
paths, matching the paper's "no directed path has two edges labelled with literals of the
same variable".

The alternative — a list of edges, with the labels recovered by a `map` — was rejected:
every lemma below would then carry a second layer (edge list, then its label list), and
the two `Path` constructors already give induction directly on the shape the proofs
recurse on.  The price is that a path does not remember which nodes it visits; nothing
here needs that, because "the path passes through `a`" is always used in its split form
`Path root a ls₁ ∧ Path a leaf ls₂`, which is also exactly the form the splice consumes.

## Uniformity is a hypothesis, and it is load-bearing

The paper declares ([Raz16, §2], and again at line 355) that
*all* {\sc nrobp}s in its Sections 3-6 are **uniform**:

* any two root-to-`a` paths are labelled by literals of the same set of variables; and
* every root-leaf path reads every variable of `F`.

`NROBP.Uniform` is exactly those two clauses.  It is carried as an explicit hypothesis of
every statement that needs it, never assumed silently, because the proof of `exists_split_isTNode`
uses it twice and would be false without it: once to turn a root-leaf path into a genuine
*permutation* of `V(G)` (so that `MatchingWidthGe` can be applied to it), and once to
know that a variable read before `a` on one path is read before `a` on every path
through `a`.

Razgon's Appendix B ([Raz16, §A]) shows that an arbitrary
{\sc nrobp} can be made uniform at the price of an `O(n)` factor in the number of edges.
**That reduction is not formalized here.**  Consequently `le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` below is a lower
bound for uniform {\sc nrobp}s, which is what Razgon's Sections 3-6 prove; deducing the
bound for arbitrary {\sc nrobp}s needs Appendix B.

## The `lbengine` hypothesis

Razgon's Theorem `lbengine` ([Raz16]) — a `t`-cover of the family of
all vertex covers of a graph of max-degree `x` has at least `2^{t/f(x)}` members — is
proved by a probabilistic argument in a separate file of this development.  Following the
discipline of `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 (*imported results are
hypotheses, never axioms*), it is **not** imported and **not** `axiom`-ed: it enters
`le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` as the named hypothesis `hEngine`, with the numeric bound `2^{t/f(x)}`
abstracted to a parameter `bound`.  A reader of the statement can therefore see exactly
what the theorem is conditional on, and the coordinator discharges `hEngine` by supplying
the covering theorem, obtaining `2^{t/f(x)} ≤ size` with no further work.

Note that `hEngine` is stated in the *unfolded* form the proof produces — "any family of
sets of size `≥ t` that covers every vertex cover has at least `bound` members" — rather
than through an intermediate `IsTCover` predicate, so that no definition has to be shared
across the file boundary.

## Bounds are explicit

There is no asymptotic notation anywhere below.  `le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` concludes `bound ≤ size`
with `size` the node count of the program and `bound` whatever number `hEngine` supplies.

/-- **A nondeterministic read-once branching program** over the variables `V`, on `size`
nodes (paper Definition 1, [Raz16, `arosrn`]).

Nodes are the indices `Fin size`; `edge a b l` says there is an edge `a → b` carrying the
label `l`, which is `none` for an unlabelled edge and `some (x, p)` for the literal `x`
(when `p = true`) or `¬x` (when `p = false`).

The read-once condition is *not* a field: it is the predicate `NROBP.ReadOnce`, which
quantifies over the inductive family `NROBP.Path` defined below and therefore cannot be
stated until that family exists.  The same goes for uniformity (`NROBP.Uniform`) and for
the connection with a formula (`NROBP.Realises`).

"Path through `a`" is written in its split form — a root-to-`a` path `ms` followed by an

Splitting this out of `exists_split_isTNode` keeps the ordering bookkeeping — which is where all of

read-once splicing argument, which needs none of it.

/-- **`exists_split_isTNode`** (paper §5, [Raz16, `tnodecut`]).
If the matching width of `G` is at least `t`, then every root-leaf path of a uniform
read-once program implementing `φ(G)` passes through a `t`-node — equivalently, the
`t`-nodes form a root-leaf cut.

The proof is Razgon's.  Fix a root-leaf path and cut it at the node `a` given by
`exists_split_crossMatching`, so that the matching `{uₖ, vₖ}` runs from variables read
before `a` to variables read after `a`.  For each `k` one shows that one of `uₖ`, `vₖ`
lies in `VC(Q)` for *every* root-leaf `Q` through `a`.  If not, there are `Q^A` missing
`uₖ` and `Q^B` missing `vₖ`; uniformity places `uₖ` before `a` and `vₖ` after `a` on both,
so `uₖ` occurs negatively on the prefix of `Q^A` and `vₖ` negatively on the suffix of
`Q^B`, and read-onceness forbids either from recurring on the other half.  Splicing the
prefix of `Q^A` to the suffix of `Q^B` therefore yields a root-leaf path whose positive
set misses both endpoints of an edge, contradicting Observation 1.

The chosen representatives are pairwise distinct — the left endpoints are distinct, the
right endpoints are distinct, and no left endpoint is a right endpoint since one side lies
inside the cut and the other outside — so the witnessing set really does have `t`
elements. -/

/-- **`le_size_of_matchingWidthGe`** (paper §5, [Raz16, `nrobplbdmw`]):
a uniform read-once nondeterministic branching program implementing `φ(G)`, for a graph
`G` of matching width at least `t`, has at least `bound` **nodes**, where `bound` is any
lower bound on the size of a `t`-cover of the family of vertex covers of `G`.

The covering bound — Razgon's Theorem 4, which supplies `bound = 2^{t/f(x)}` for `x` the
max-degree of `G` — enters as the hypothesis `hEngine` rather than as an import or an
axiom; see `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 and the module docstring.
Uniformity likewise remains a hypothesis: Razgon's Appendix B, which removes it at an
`O(n)` factor in the edge count, is not formalized here.

The proof is Razgon's.  Choose, for each `t`-node `a`, one witnessing set `S(a)`; the
family of these sets covers every vertex cover, since a vertex cover is `VC(P)` for some
root-leaf path `P` (Observation 1) and `P` meets a `t`-node (`exists_split_isTNode`).  So `hEngine`
bounds the number of *distinct* witnessing sets from below, and that number is at most the
number of `t`-nodes, hence at most `size`. -/
