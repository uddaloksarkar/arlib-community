# Theorem `lbengine`: a `t`-cover of the vertex covers is exponentially large

Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching programs and CNFs of
bounded treewidth*, Theorem `lbengine` ([Raz16]),
proved in Subsection `lbenproof` ([Raz16, §4.1]).

Say a family `A` of subsets of `V(H)` **covers** the vertex covers of `H` if
every vertex cover of `H` contains some member of `A`, and call it a
**`t`-cover** if in addition every member has size at least `t`
([Raz16, §4]).  The theorem: a `t`-cover of `VC(H)` has
at least `2^{t/f(x)}` members, where `x` bounds the max-degree of `H` and `f` is
determined by `2^{-1/f(x)} = (1 - 2^{-x})^{1/(x+1)}`.

The consumer is Theorem `le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` ([Raz16, `nrobplbdmw`]),
which feeds in the family of witnessing sets `S(a)` of the `t`-nodes of a
branching program and reads off a lower bound on the number of nodes.  It wants
two shapes, and both are provided: `card_ge_of_isTCover`, a "no fixed point
survives" inequality with no division and no logarithm, and
`two_rpow_le_card`, the paper's `2^{t/f(x)} ≤ |A|` with `f` spelled out.

## Counting, not probability

The paper's argument tosses a fair coin for each edge `e = {u,v}` and calls the
outcome `Out(e) ∈ {u,v}`.  We keep the argument and drop the coins: every
quantity in the proof is `|{outcomes with some property}|`, the sample space is
finite and uniform, and the union bound at the end is `|Ω| ≤ Σ_{S ∈ A} |Ω_S|`.
This is the same substitution made in
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/LowerBounds/AffinePerms.lean` and
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/LowerBounds/ClaimPerm.lean`, for the same reasons:
a measure would have to be divided out again at the end, and the counting form
is the sharper statement.  Only the very last step needs `ℝ`, because the
exponent `|S|/(x+1)` is not an integer.

## The encoding of an outcome

An outcome is
```
Outcome V := ∀ e : Sym2 V, {x : V // x ∈ e}
```
— a *dependent* choice function on unordered pairs, choosing one endpoint of
each pair.  Three encodings were considered and this one was chosen for the
following reasons.

* A function `V → V → Bool` with `o u v = !o v u` is a subtype, so its
  cardinality is not `Fintype.card_pi`, and the disjointness/product step would
  have to be redone by hand.
* A function `Sym2 V → Bool` needs a canonical labelling of the two endpoints
  of each pair by `true`/`false`, which needs a linear order on `V` that the
  statement does not mention; carrying one through would force either an extra
  hypothesis or a `Trunc`-elimination in every lemma.
* The dependent form above needs no order at all: `{x // x ∈ e}` *is* the pair
  of endpoints, and `Fintype.card (∀ i, β i) = ∏ i, Fintype.card (β i)`
  applies verbatim.  Its fibres have size `2` over the edges of `H` and size
  `1` over the diagonal; the diagonal and the non-edges are inert coordinates
  that cancel out of every ratio, so they cost nothing and save the bookkeeping
  of indexing by `G.edgeFinset`.

`outcomeSet G c` is the paper's `Out(E)`: the image of the edge set under `c`.
It is always a vertex cover (`isVertexCover_outcomeSet`), which is the half of
the argument that makes the contradiction bite.

## Independence, as a grafting bijection

The paper's step (ii) is "for an independent set `I` the edge sets `E_u`,
`u ∈ I`, are pairwise disjoint, hence the events `u ∈ Out(E)` are independent".
Stated as a count this is `|Ω_{P ∧ Q}| · |Ω| = |Ω_P| · |Ω_Q|` for `P` depending
only on a set `A` of coordinates and `Q` only on its complement, and it is
proved here by an explicit involution on *pairs* of outcomes
(`card_filter_and_mul_card`): swapping the `A`-coordinates of `(c, d)` matches
the pairs with `P c ∧ Q c` bijectively with the pairs with `Q c ∧ P d`.  No
product-type equivalence, no measure-theoretic independence, and the lemma is
stated for an arbitrary finite dependent product so that it is reusable.

The single-vertex count `Pr(u ∈ Out(E_u)) = 1 - 2^{-|E_u|}` is the complementary
event "`c` avoids `u` on every edge at `u`", which *is* a coordinatewise
condition, so it is counted by `card_filter_forall_mul` via
`Equiv.subtypePiEquivPi`.

## What the paper skips

Two steps are asserted in the source and supplied here in full.

* "any `S` contains an independent set of size at least `|S|/(x+1)`"
  ([Raz16, §4.1]) is `exists_indep_subset`, proved by the
  greedy strong induction on `S.card`: delete a vertex together with its at most
  `x` neighbours.
* The degenerate cases.  `x = 0` makes the base `1 - 2^0 = 0` and every
  `rpow` lemma about a base in `(0,1)` inapplicable; it is dispatched
  separately, using that a graph of max-degree `0` has `∅` as a vertex cover,
  which forces `t = 0`.  `A = ∅` never occurs: `Finset.univ` is a vertex cover,
  so the covering hypothesis already produces a member of `A`.

  `|{c | P c ∧ Q c}| · |Ω| = |{c | Q c}| · |{c | P c}|`,

which is `Pr(P ∧ Q) = Pr(P)·Pr(Q)` cleared of denominators.

The proof is the grafting involution on `Ω × Ω`: a pair `(c, d)` with
`P c ∧ Q c` is sent to the pair whose first component takes its `A`-coordinates
from `d` (so it still satisfies `Q`) and whose second takes its `A`-coordinates
from `c` (so it satisfies `P`). -/

This is the count behind `Pr(u ∉ Out(E_u)) = 2^{-|E_u|}`
([Raz16, §4.1]): avoiding `u` is a separate constraint on
each edge at `u`, and each constraint leaves exactly one of the two endpoints

/-- **Theorem `lbengine`** ([Raz16]), in the form
"no size below the threshold survives": if `A` is a `t`-cover of the vertex
covers of `H` and `H` has max-degree at most `x`, then

  `(1 - 2^{-x})^{t/(x+1)} · |A| ≥ 1`,

equivalently `|A| ≥ (1 - 2^{-x})^{-t/(x+1)}`.

The hypotheses are exactly the paper's: `hsize` is "`A` is a `t`-cover" and
`hcov` is "`A` covers `VC(H)`".  No nondegeneracy is assumed: `A = ∅` is
impossible because `hcov` applied to `Finset.univ` produces a member, and
`x = 0` forces `t = 0` and the statement reduces to `|A| ≥ 1`.

The proof: every outcome selects a vertex cover, hence contains a member of
`A`, so the sample space is covered by the events `S ⊆ Out(c)`, `S ∈ A`; each
such event has at most a `(1 - 2^{-x})^{t/(x+1)}` fraction of the sample space
by `count_le_rpow`; so `|A|` times that fraction is at least `1`. -/
