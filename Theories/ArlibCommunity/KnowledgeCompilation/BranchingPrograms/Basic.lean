# The graph vocabulary behind Razgon's lower bound

Shared foundation for `BranchingPrograms/`, which follows Igor Razgon, *On the
read-once property of branching programs and CNFs of bounded treewidth*,
Algorithmica 75(2):277–294, 2016 ([Raz16]).

Three notions, and one design decision each.

## `φ(G)`: the monotone 2-CNF of a graph

A graph `G` without isolated vertices corresponds to the 2-CNF whose variables
are the vertices and whose clauses are `(u ∨ v)` for each edge.  We do **not**
build a syntactic CNF: the paper immediately replaces `φ(G)` by its semantics
(its Observation 1) and never looks at the formula again.  So `phi G α` is
directly the predicate "`α` satisfies every clause", and the bridge to graph
theory is `phi_iff_isVertexCover`: *the vertices set true by a satisfying
assignment are exactly a vertex cover*.

The isolated-vertex proviso is the paper's, and is about the correspondence
being a *bijection* between graphs and formulas.  Nothing here needs it —
an isolated vertex simply gives a variable that no clause mentions — so it is
not a hypothesis anywhere.

## Cross matchings, as indexed families

A matching of size `t` between `S` and its complement is recorded as a pair of
injective functions `Fin t → V` rather than as a `Finset` of edges with a
disjointness condition.  The size is then the index type and is fixed before the
data, so "there is a matching of size `t`" is a predicate on `t` with no
cardinality side condition — the same reason `Arlib.Communication.Rectangle` indexes
covers by `Fin k`.  Injectivity is required of each side separately; the two
sides cannot collide with each other, since one lands in `S` and the other
outside it.

## Matching width, as a lower-bound predicate only

`mw(G)` is a min over orderings of a max over prefixes.  We define only
`MatchingWidthGe G t` — "*every* ordering has a prefix with a cross matching of
size `t`" — and never the number.

That is not a shortcut.  Every statement in the paper about matching width is a
lower bound (`mw(T_r(H)) ≥ …`, "if `mw(G) ≥ t` then every root-leaf path …"),
and `MatchingWidthGe` is exactly the form both the producer and the consumer
want: `dmwtwstruct` proves the `∀ ordering, ∃ prefix` statement directly, and
`exists_split_isTNode` consumes it by feeding in the ordering induced by one path.  A
numeric `mw` would sit between them as a `sSup` needing a boundedness side
condition at each use, and would have to be unfolded to this predicate anyway.
