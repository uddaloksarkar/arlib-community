# Appendix B: the {\sc arosrn} and the traditional {\sc nrobp} are the same model

Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching programs and CNFs of bounded
treewidth*, Appendix B ([Raz16, §B]), together with the
Remark that announces it at [Raz16, §2].

`BranchingPrograms/NROBP.lean` formalizes the paper's Definition 1
([Raz16, `arosrn`]), which — as that Remark admits — is not the
textbook nondeterministic read-once branching program at all but the *acyclic read-once
switching-and-rectifier network*: one root, one leaf, labels on **edges**.  The textbook
object has labels on **nodes** and two leaves.  This file builds the two translations, so
that a lower bound proved for the paper's model may be quoted against a textbook
{\sc nrobp} or {\sc fbdd}.  Everything the paper compresses into two occurrences of "it is
not hard to see" is spelled out below; §"What the paper leaves implicit" records what that
phrase was hiding.

## The traditional model

`Equivalence.TraditionalBP V size` is Razgon's `Z` of
[Raz16, §B]: a {\sc dag} on the nodes `Fin size` with a
root and two distinguished leaves, a partial node labelling `varLabel : Fin size → Option V`,
and edges labelled by `Option Bool` — `none` for an edge out of a *guessing* node
([Raz16, §2]), `some p` for the `p`-branch out of a node labelled
with a variable.  The structure fields record exactly the paper's demands: a labelled node
has an out-edge for each of `true` and `false` (`out_edge`) and no two out-edges with the
same answer (`out_unique`), a labelled edge leaves a labelled node (`edge_decision`), an
unlabelled edge leaves an unlabelled one (`edge_guess`), and the two leaves are distinct
sinks.  Acyclicity is `edge_lt`, the same field and for the same three reasons as in
`NROBP` — see that module's docstring.

The read-once condition is *not* a field, for the same reason as in `NROBP`: it quantifies
over `TraditionalBP.Path`, which cannot be defined until the structure exists.

`TraditionalBP.Path` implements the paper's reading convention verbatim
([Raz16, §B]): "it is convenient to see each edge `e`
labelled with `true` or `false` being in fact labelled with the positive or negative
literal of the variable labelling the tail of `e`".  Its `step` constructor takes the
node's label `y` and the edge's answer `p` and conses the literal `(y, p)`; its `skip`
constructor pushes an unlabelled edge and leaves the literal list alone.  So `A(P)` is
computed for a traditional program by exactly the same inductive family as for an
{\sc arosrn}, and the two `Path` types are directly comparable — which is the whole point.

## Semantics: a general "computes `f`", related to `NROBP.Realises`

`NROBP.Realises` is stated against `φ(G)`.  The equivalence has nothing to do with `φ(G)`,
so the semantics used here is `Equivalence.ComputesBy`, a predicate on an arbitrary set of
accepting literal lists and an arbitrary Boolean function, with the paper's two clauses
(soundness: every extension of an accepted list satisfies `f`; completeness: every model
of `f` extends an accepted list).  `Equivalence.Computes` and
`Equivalence.TraditionalBP.Computes` instantiate it at root-leaf and root-`true`-leaf paths
respectively, and `Equivalence.computes_iff_realises` says `Computes Z (phi G) ↔ Z.Realises G`
by `Iff.rfl`-strength reasoning, so the corollaries at the foot of the file transport
`Razgon.two_rpow_le_size` with no friction.  Because `ComputesBy` mentions only the literal
lists, transport along a path bijection is a one-line `ComputesBy.congr`.

## Direction 1 (traditional ⟶ {\sc arosrn}): no cost at all, and the deletion is avoidable

`TraditionalBP.toNROBP` keeps the node set, the root, and every edge, moves the label of a
node onto its out-edges, and declares the `true` leaf to be *the* leaf.  `Fin size` in,
`Fin size` out: **no increase in nodes and none in edges**, which is stronger than the
paper's "without increase of the number of edges" ([Raz16, §2]).

Razgon's recipe ([Raz16, §B]) additionally *deletes* the
`false` leaf and every node from which the `true` leaf is unreachable, and for that reason
has to assume the computed function is not constantly `false`.  **Both the deletion and the
hypothesis are avoidable here, and that is a genuine simplification of the paper.**  The
reason is visible in `NROBP`: `root` and `leaf` are two *designated indices*, nothing in the
structure asserts that every node is reachable from the root, that the leaf is reachable
from every node, or that the leaf is the unique sink; and `NROBP.Realises` — like
`ComputesBy` — speaks only of root-leaf paths.  Unreachable junk therefore contributes no
root-leaf path and cannot change the computed function or the read-once property.  The
paper needs the non-triviality hypothesis only because a constantly-`false` program loses
its root to the deletion and stops being a {\sc dag} with a root and a leaf; with nothing
deleted, there is nothing to assume.  The price of the simplification is that `toNROBP`
proves a *node* bound of `size` rather than exhibiting a smaller program; since the results
being transported are lower bounds on the node count, a program that is not made smaller is
exactly what is wanted.

## Direction 2 ({\sc arosrn} ⟶ traditional): the encoding, and why

This is the direction with real content, and the obstacle is bureaucratic rather than
mathematical: `NROBP V size` indexes nodes by `Fin size` and carries
`edge_lt : edge a b l → a < b`, while Razgon's construction
([Raz16, §B]) *subdivides every labelled edge* with a
fresh node and adds a `false` leaf.  Each new node must be inserted strictly between the
endpoints of the edge it subdivides, so the target index type is not `Fin size` and the
insertion is a global re-indexing.

**What was rejected.**  A per-edge induction — subdivide one edge, re-index, recurse — was
rejected outright: every step changes the type, so the induction hypothesis has to be
transported along an `Order.Iso` at each of `|E|` steps, and the path bijection has to be
re-proved after each transport.  A node type `Fin size ⊕ (Fin size × Fin size × Lit V) ⊕
Unit` with a bespoke `LinearOrder`, transported to `Fin size'` by
`MonoEquiv.ofUnique`-style order isomorphism, was also rejected: the order has to be
defined by hand anyway, and one then pays twice, once to prove it is a linear order and
once to transport every lemma across the isomorphism.

**What is used instead: a fixed arithmetic layout.**  Reserve, once and for all, a *column*
of `m + 1` consecutive indices for each original node, where `m` is the number of possible
`(target, literal)` pairs; then append a single index for the `false` leaf.  Concretely,
with `m = slotCount V size = size * (2 * |V|)`:

* the original node `u` sits at index `u * (m + 1)`   (`origIdx`);
* the subdivision node of the edge `u → v` labelled `x` sits at index
  `u * (m + 1) + 1 + ⟪v, x⟫`, where `⟪·⟫ : Fin size × Lit V ≃ Fin m` is any bijection
  (`slotIdx`, `bddSub`);
* the `false` leaf sits at index `size * (m + 1)` (`falseIdx`).

`edge_lt` is then pure arithmetic and needs no order isomorphism: a subdivision node of an
edge out of `u` lies inside `u`'s column, hence above `u`; and it lies below `(u+1)*(m+1)`,
hence below every later column, in particular below `v`, because `u < v` in the source
program.  Decoding is division and remainder by `m + 1` (`decodeSlot`), which makes
`varLabel` a total function of the index — no choice, no partiality — and makes the three
node kinds provably distinct and jointly exhaustive (`layout_cases`).

**The cost, stated explicitly.**  The construction lands in
`TraditionalBP V (bddSize V size)` with

```
bddSize V size = size * (size * (2 * |V|) + 1) + 1.
```

That is an honest node bound but a loose one: only `size + (number of labelled edges) + 1`
of those indices are ever the endpoint of an edge, the rest being empty slots that carry no
label (`bddVarLabel` returns `none` on them) and no edge.  In *edges* — the quantity
Razgon's Remark actually measures ([Raz16, §2]) — the blow-up is
the paper's: an unlabelled edge is copied, a labelled edge becomes the three edges
`u → w`, `w → v`, `w → false`, so at most a threefold increase, and the empty slots
contribute nothing.  Compressing the index range down to `size + |E_labelled| + 1` would
require enumerating the edge relation — a `Fintype`/`DecidablePred` layer on `Z.edge` that
the `NROBP` structure does not provide — and would be a second re-indexing with no
mathematical content, so it is not done.

Dropping the field `out_unique` (allowing a decision node several out-edges with the same
answer, which is a guessing node's job and is a harmless generalisation of the model) would
let all edges out of `u` labelled `x` share one subdivision node and shrink the bound to
`size * (2 * |V| + 1) + 1`.  The stronger, textbook-faithful model was preferred: it makes
Direction 1 — the direction the lower-bound corollaries travel — a statement about genuine
textbook programs.

## What the paper leaves implicit

Two sentences of Appendix B carry real work.

1. "*It is not hard to see that ... the obtained graph is an {\sc arosrn} computing exactly
   the same function as `Z`*" ([Raz16, §B]).  What has to be
   checked is that the relabelled graph's root-leaf paths carry the *same literal lists* as
   the original's root-`true`-leaf paths.  Here that is `toNROBP_path_iff`, and it is short
   only because `TraditionalBP.Path` was defined to read literals in the first place; the
   moment one writes the traditional model with `Bool`-labelled edges and reads the literal
   off the tail's label — as the paper does — the two path families become different
   inductive types and the correspondence is a genuine (if easy) double induction.  The
   deletion step, by contrast, is not easy, and is avoided; see above.

2. "*It is not hard to see that there is a bijection between root-leaf paths of the
   {\sc arosrn} and root-true leaf paths of the resulting {\sc nrobp} preserving the
   associated sets of literals*" ([Raz16, §B]).  The forward half
   is a routine induction (`bddOf_path_of_path`).  The backward half is not, and the reason
   is the `false` leaf: a traditional path arriving at a subdivision node `w` may leave by
   *either* of `w`'s two out-edges, and the wrong one reads the *complementary* literal.
   What rules it out is that the `false` leaf is a sink and is not the `true` leaf, so such
   a path can never reach the target — a fact the paper never states.  Formally this forces
   the induction to be run on a *conjunction* of two statements, one for paths starting at
   an original node and one for paths starting at a subdivision node (which still "owe" the
   literal of the edge being subdivided): `bddOf_reflect`.  A single-statement induction is
   impossible, because the two node kinds have different relationships to the source
   program.

   The same subtlety reappears, in a weaker form, for the read-once property
   (`bddOf_readOnce`).  Read-onceness quantifies over *all* directed paths, including those
   that end at the `false` leaf, and such a path reads `¬x` where the source program's
   corresponding path reads `x`.  Since read-onceness constrains only the *variables*, the
   statement transported is "some path of `Z` reads the same list of variables"
   (`bddOf_vars`), not "the same list of literals"; that weakening is what makes the
   `false`-leaf branch go through.

   Finally, an {\sc arosrn}'s leaf really is a leaf, whereas `NROBP` does not record this.
   The backward construction therefore takes `hsink : ∀ b l, ¬ Z.edge Z.leaf b l` as an
   explicit hypothesis — needed, and only needed, to certify that the resulting `true` leaf
   is a sink.

## Two honest caveats about the statements

**"Bijection" is rendered as an equality of literal-list sets.**  `Path` is a `Prop`
indexed by the literal list a path reads, so individual paths are not named and there is no
function to exhibit.  What `bddOf_path_iff` proves is that a list is read by some root-leaf
path of the {\sc arosrn} exactly when it is read by some root-to-`true`-leaf path of the
traditional program.  That is precisely the content the paper's "bijection ... preserving
the associated sets of literals" is used for — nothing downstream distinguishes two paths
with the same literals — and it is the form `ComputesBy.congr` consumes.

**Direction 2 needs `V` finite; Direction 1 does not.**  The layout reserves one slot per
`(target, literal)` pair, so `Fintype V` enters the *construction*, not the mathematics.
`TraditionalBP`, `toNROBP` and the whole of Direction 1 are stated over an arbitrary `V`.

The bundle `TraditionalBP` has thirteen fields, four of them positive demands, so
`traditionalTrivial` inhabits it: see `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 for why
an uninhabited hypothesis bundle would make every theorem below vacuous while
`#print axioms` reported nothing.

## Uniformity is only partly transported backwards, and the `false` leaf is why

`NROBP.Uniform` transports along Direction 1 (`toNROBP_uniform`), which is all the
corollaries need.  Along Direction 2 it transports for *every node except the `false`
leaf*, and no further — a correction to what this section used to claim.

`Uniform.prefix_vars` quantifies over paths ending at an arbitrary node, so it must be
checked at all three node kinds.  Original targets are `bddOf_reflect`; subdivision targets
("the middle of a column") were said to need "a third reflection lemma", and that lemma is
now here — `bddOf_reflect_sub`, the mirror of `bddOf_reflect` across a subdivision node —
with `bddOf_prefix_vars_bddSub` reading `prefix_vars` off it.  So the subdivision node was
*not* the obstruction.

The `false` leaf is, and it is a genuine one, not a missing lemma.  Two root-to-`false`-leaf
paths through the subdivision nodes of two different labelled edges `u → v` and `u' → v'`
read the variable sets `Var(v)` and `Var(v')` respectively (the reject branch adds `Var(x)`
to `Var(u)`, and uniformity of `Z` makes that `Var(v)`), and those need not be equal.  The
three-node {\sc arosrn} `0 →(p) 1 →(q) 2` is uniform yet gives root-to-`false`-leaf paths
reading `{p}` and `{p, q}`, so `bddOf` is *not* uniform.  Hence the full
`Z.Uniform → (bddOf Z).Uniform` is false and is deliberately not stated; the achievable
fragment is `bddOf_prefix_vars_bddSub` together with the original-node case of
`bddOf_reflect`.

## Bounds are explicit

No asymptotic notation appears below.  Direction 1 produces a program on exactly `size`
nodes; Direction 2 produces one on `size * (size * (2 * Fintype.card V) + 1) + 1` nodes.

/-! ## The index layout for Direction 2

A fixed arithmetic layout of `Fin (size * (m + 1) + 1)`: node `u` of the source program
occupies index `u * (m + 1)`, the `m` indices above it are its private column of
subdivision slots, and the single index `size * (m + 1)` at the top is the `false` leaf.
See the module docstring for why this was preferred to an order isomorphism out of a sum
type. -/

/-- **The subdivision-node reflection lemma** ([Raz16, §B]), the
"third reflection lemma (targets in the middle of a column)" the module docstring flags as
missing for the backward transport of `Uniform`.

It is `bddOf_reflect` with the target moved from an original node `origIdx w` to a
subdivision node `bddSub u₁ v₁ x₁` — the middle of a column.  As there, two statements are
proved by one induction because a traditional path may start at an original node or at a
subdivision node.  The only in-edge to `bddSub u₁ v₁ x₁` is the unlabelled edge
`origIdx u₁ → bddSub u₁ v₁ x₁`, which reads no literal; hence a path reaching the
subdivision node reads exactly what a path reaching `origIdx u₁` reads, and the reflected
{\sc arosrn} path lands on `u₁` carrying the *same* literal list.  The start-at-subdivision
clause carries a disjunction absent from `bddOf_reflect`: a path that *starts* at
`bddSub u v x` and ends there is empty and owes nothing, whereas one that leaves owes `x`,
its accepting branch reading it — the rejecting branch is excluded because the `false` leaf
is a sink distinct from every subdivision node. -/

([Raz16, §B]): if the {\sc arosrn} `Z` is uniform then any two

This is the subdivision-node case of `TraditionalBP.Uniform.prefix_vars`, discharged by the
reflection lemma above: both paths reflect to {\sc arosrn} paths `Z.root → u` carrying the
*same* literal lists as the traditional paths, and `Z`'s own `prefix_vars` equates their

This is the weakening the `false` leaf forces, and it is the reason `bddOf_reflect` cannot

node reads `¬x` where the source program reads `x`, so the *literal* lists differ.  They
agree after `List.map Prod.fst`, which is all read-onceness looks at.

/-! ## The lower bound, read as a bound on textbook programs

Direction 1 carries `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size` and `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph`
([Raz16, §4], [Raz16, `maintheor`]) across to the traditional model with no loss
at all, since `toNROBP` does not change the node count. -/

/-- **`le_size_of_matchingWidthGe` for a textbook {\sc nrobp}** ([Raz16, `nrobplbdmw`]):
a uniform read-once *traditional* nondeterministic branching program — variable-labelled
decision nodes, guessing nodes, a `true` and a `false` leaf — computing `φ(G)` for a graph
`G` of matching width at least `t` and max-degree at most `x` has at least
`2^{t / f(x)}` nodes.

This is `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size` fed through Direction 1.  No constant is lost: `toNROBP`
produces an {\sc arosrn} on exactly the same node set, so the bound proved for the paper's
model is literally the bound for the textbook one. -/

/-- **Razgon's Theorem `two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` for a textbook {\sc nrobp}**
([Raz16, `maintheor`]): for `G = T_r(P_{2p})`, every uniform read-once
traditional nondeterministic branching program computing `φ(G)` has at least
`2^{((r+1-⌈log₂ p⌉)·p/2) / f(5)}` nodes.

The statement that the {\sc nrobp} lower bound of this development is a lower bound in the
*textbook* sense, and hence a lower bound for {\sc fbdd}s, which are the special case with
no guessing nodes ([Raz16, §2]). -/
