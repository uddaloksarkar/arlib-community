# decision-DNNF, ROBP, and Razgon's Theorem `decisionDNNF_robp_separation`

The last theorem of Igor Razgon, *On the read-once property of branching programs and
CNFs of bounded treewidth*, Algorithmica 75(2):277–294, 2016 ([Raz16, `separ2`]):

> There is an infinite class of CNF formulas such that the complexity of decision-DNNF
> on this class is `O(n⁵)` while the complexity of ROBP is `Ω(n^{log n / c})` for some
> universal constant `c`.

The class is `φ(T_r(P_{2r}))`, the monotone 2-CNF of a complete binary tree of height `r`
with a path on `2r` vertices hung at each node.  The theorem has two halves that share
nothing but the graph:

* the **lower bound** is Lemma `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size` ([Raz16, `separ`]) — the matching-width machinery of
  `BranchingPrograms/NROBP.lean` and `BranchingPrograms/TreeProduct.lean` — together with
  the one-line observation that an ROBP is a special case of an NROBP;
* the **upper bound** is Oztok–Darwiche's `O(2^t·n)` compilation bound for CNFs of primal
  treewidth `t`, plus the treewidth bound `tw(T_r(P_{2r})) ≤ 4r − 1`, which
  `TreeProduct.treewidthLe_binTree_boxProd` (and hence
  `TreeProduct.binTree_pathGraph_bounds`) already supplies.

Razgon's closing remark ([Raz16, §7]) is what the theorem is for: it shows that the
quasi-polynomial simulation of decision-DNNF by ROBP (Beame–Li–Roy–Suciu) is essentially
tight.

## decision-DNNF, in the NNF DAG encoding

A **decision node** is an `∨`-node whose two children are `∧`-nodes, one of which has the
literal `x` among its two children and the other the literal `¬x`, for one and the same
variable `x`; a **decision-DNNF** is a DNNF all of whose `∨`-nodes are decision nodes.  In
the encoding of `Circuits/NNF.lean` — nodes are indices `Fin size`, `gate i` labels node
`i`, and size is the *vertex count of a DAG*, never of a tree (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.1) — that
is `IsDecisionNode` and `IsDecisionDNNF` below.  No new circuit datatype is introduced:
decision-DNNF is a *predicate* on `NNF`, in the same idiom as `IsDNNF` and `IsdDNNF`, so
that the containment below is a statement about one and the same object.

Two modelling choices are worth stating.

*Either conjunct may carry the literal.*  `IsLitConj C j x p` asks that `j` be an `∧`-node
with `C.gate a = .lit x p` for `a` **one of** its two children, rather than fixing the
literal in the left slot.  A picture of a decision-DNNF always draws `x ∧ φ` with the
literal on the left, but nothing in the definition of the language justifies excluding the
mirror image, and a containment lemma proved for the *larger* class is the stronger
theorem — the same reasoning that makes `Circuits/NNF.lean` relativize its conditions to
the reachable nodes rather than quantify over every index.  The extra generality costs one
`rcases` in `IsLitConj.forces` and nothing anywhere else.

*Relativized to reachability.*  `DecisionFrom C r` quantifies over the `∨`-nodes reachable
from `r`, and `IsDecision C` is `DecisionFrom C C.root`, matching `Decomposable` and
`Deterministic` exactly.  An index of `Fin size` that no directed path from the source
visits is not a node of the circuit; see the module docstring of `Circuits/NNF.lean` for
why quantifying over all indices would define a strictly smaller class and hence prove a
weaker theorem.

## What the containment costs

`IsDecisionDNNF.isdDNNF` — **decision-DNNF ⊆ d-DNNF** — goes through unconditionally, and
cheaply.  Determinism at an `∨`-node `(x ∧ φ) ∨ (¬x ∧ ψ)` is immediate: an assignment
satisfying the left child satisfies `x`, one satisfying the right child satisfies `¬x`, and
no assignment does both.  Decomposability is not used at all, and is simply carried along:
`IsDecisionDNNF` is `Decomposable ∧ IsDecision`, and the second conjunct alone yields
`Deterministic` (`DecisionFrom.deterministicFrom`).

Nothing below claims the converse, and `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` should not be misread as proving it:
`decisionDNNF_robp_separation` compares decision-DNNF with *ROBP*, and in that comparison decision-DNNF is the
**stronger** model — it represents `φ(T_r(P_{2r}))` in `O(n⁵)` nodes where every ROBP needs
`n^{Ω(log n)}`.  The containment above and the separation below therefore pull in opposite
directions, which is exactly why the pair is interesting: decision-DNNF sits strictly
between ROBP and d-DNNF.

## ROBP as a special case of an NROBP

`ROBP.Deterministic` is "an NROBP without guessing nodes", spelled out on Razgon's AROSRN
encoding (Definition `arosrn`): no unlabelled edge leaves any node, all edges
leaving a node test the same variable, and no two edges leaving a node carry the same
literal.  That is exactly the traditional FBDD — a node labelled by a variable with one
out-edge per value — read through the translation of Razgon's Appendix C ([Raz16, §B]), after
the `false` leaf and the nodes that cannot reach the `true` leaf have been deleted, which
is why a node may end up with fewer than two out-edges and the definition is phrased as
three negative conditions rather than as "exactly two out-edges".

Only the **cheap direction** is here, and it is all `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` needs: a deterministic NROBP
is an NROBP, so every lower bound on NROBP size applies a fortiori
(`ROBP.size_ge_of_nrobp`, whose determinism hypothesis is deliberately unused — that is the
whole point).  The equivalence of the AROSRN and the traditional guessing-node definition
(Appendix C, `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §8.4 item 4) is *not* attempted here.
`ROBP.Deterministic.next_unique` is included so that the predicate is visibly about
something: under an assignment, a deterministic node has at most one consistent out-edge.

## Why the Oztok–Darwiche bound is imported, and what would discharge it

Razgon cites Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche, *On compiling CNF into decision-DNNF*, CP 2014,
LNCS 8656, pp. 42–57 ([OD14]), Theorem 1: a CNF of primal treewidth `t` has a decision-DNNF of size `O(2^t·n)`.  **That
paper is not formalized here** — the other Oztok–Darwiche paper used in this area,
[OD17], *On Compiling DNNFs without Determinism*, does not contain this bound — so the
result is an import, and it is treated exactly as `LowerBounds/Imported.lean` treats the
imports of the other paper in this area (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3): a `structure` carrying explicit
data and hypotheses, threaded into the theorem that consumes it, never an `axiom`.

Three things are made explicit.

*The constants.*  `O(2^t·n)` hides a multiplicative and possibly an additive constant, so
the bundle is parameterized by `mulConst` and `addConst` and concludes
`|C| ≤ mulConst·(2^t·n) + addConst` (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5: state the explicit bound, never the
asymptotic class).

*The formula.*  This area builds no CNF datatype — `Basic.lean` replaces `φ(G)` by its
semantics immediately — so the bundle is stated for `φ(G)`, whose primal graph is `G`
itself: the variables are the vertices and there is one clause `(u ∨ v)` per edge, so two
variables share a clause exactly when the corresponding vertices are adjacent.  "Primal
treewidth at most `t`" is therefore literally `TreeProduct.TreewidthLe G t`.  This is the
only instance of the import that `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` uses, and stating the bundle at exactly its point
of use is what keeps it honest.

*The parameter.*  Razgon notes ([Raz16, §7]) that Oztok–Darwiche's theorem is in fact stated
for a different parameter of a CNF, which is shown there never to exceed the primal
treewidth; the bundle records the consequence Razgon uses, at the treewidth, which is the
weaker and hence safer form.

**What would discharge it**: an implementation of the Oztok–Darwiche compiler — DPLL with
component caching, driven along a tree decomposition — together with a proof that the
circuit it emits is decomposable, has only decision nodes, computes `φ(G)`, and has the
stated size.  Anyone who supplies that deletes the bundle and every statement below becomes
unconditional with no other change.

*Non-vacuity.*  A bundle whose fields were jointly unsatisfiable would make `decisionDNNF_robp_separation`
vacuously true while `#print axioms` reported nothing wrong, so — following the non-vacuity
section of `LowerBounds/Imported.lean` — the bundle is inhabited, at
`oztokDarwiche_witness : OztokDarwiche (Fin 2) 0 7`.  The witness is honest about what it
is: with `mulConst = 0` the bound degenerates to the constant `7`, so it says nothing
whatsoever about the `2^t·n` growth, which is the imported theorem.  What it does establish
is that the fields do not contradict each other — that a decision-DNNF really can compute
`φ(G)` — and it is not degenerate in the interesting direction: on the one graph on two
vertices that has an edge, the witness is `decisionOr`, an honest seven-node decision-DNNF
for `x₀ ∨ x₁` containing an actual decision node.

## `O(n⁵)`, made explicit

`decisionDNNF_robp_separation_quintic` is Razgon's arithmetic ([Raz16, §7]) with every step spelled out and no
"sufficiently large `r`".  For `G = T_r(P_{2r})` with `1 ≤ r`:

* `n = (2^{r+1} − 1)·2r` and `tw(G) ≤ 2·(2r) − 1 = 4r − 1`
  (`TreeProduct.treewidthLe_binTree_boxProd`);
* `2^{r+1} ≤ n`, hence `r + 1 ≤ ⌊log₂ n⌋` and so `4r − 1 ≤ 4·⌊log₂ n⌋ + 4` — this replaces
  the paper's "for a sufficiently large `r`, `r ≤ log n + 1`" by an inequality valid for
  every `r ≥ 1`;
* therefore `2^t·n ≤ 16·n⁵` (`pow_mul_le_of_log_le`), and the compiled circuit has at most
  `mulConst·(16·n⁵) + addConst` nodes.

That last number *is* the paper's `O(n⁵)`.

One discrepancy in the paper is worth flagging: the statements of `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size` ([Raz16, `separ`]) and
`decisionDNNF_robp_separation` ([Raz16, `separ2`]) both name the class `φ(T_r(P_r))`, while both proofs compute
throughout with `T_r(P_{2r})`.  We follow the proofs; `decisionDNNF_robp_separation_binTree_pathGraph` is stated for
`T_r(P_{2p})` with `p` free, and `decisionDNNF_robp_separation_quintic` specializes to `p = r`, which is the
instance the paper's arithmetic is about.

## The lower bound is a hypothesis

`decisionDNNF_robp_separation` takes the NROBP lower bound as the explicit parameter `hLower` rather than
importing it.  This is the same discipline as `NROBP.le_size_of_matchingWidthGe`'s `hEngine`: the two
halves of the separation share no vocabulary, and a reader of the statement can see exactly
what it is conditional on.  `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` in `BranchingPrograms/Separation.lean` is
what discharges it, at `lowerBound = ⌈2^{((r+1−⌈log₂ r⌉)·r/2)/f(5)}⌉₊`.

## Bounds are explicit

There is no asymptotic notation anywhere below.  Every size bound is a closed-form natural
number in the parameters, and `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` concludes a two-sided statement: a decision-DNNF of
size at most an explicit polynomial exists, and every ROBP has at least `lowerBound` nodes.

/-! ## ROBP: an NROBP without guessing nodes -/

namespace ROBP

variable {V : Type*} {size : ℕ}

/-- **`Z` has no guessing nodes** — i.e. `Z` is an ROBP (an FBDD), presented inside
Razgon's AROSRN model (Definition `arosrn`, [Raz16]).

Three clauses, all negative:

* `no_guess`: no unlabelled edge, so a step of the program always reads a variable;
* `test_same_var`: all edges leaving a node test the same variable, so a node *is* a test
  of one variable;
* `succ_unique`: no two edges leaving a node carry the same literal, so the outcome of that
  test determines the successor.

Together these say that the out-edges of a node are the two branches `x = 1`, `x = 0` of a
single variable test — the traditional FBDD — except that a node may have *fewer* than two
out-edges.  That slack is not laxity: the AROSRN attached to a traditional ROBP is obtained
by deleting the `false` leaf and every node from which the `true` leaf is unreachable
(Appendix C, [Raz16, §B]), which is exactly what removes out-edges.

See the module docstring: only the a-fortiori direction is developed here, which is all
`decisionDNNF_robp_separation` needs. -/

`α`, any two out-edges of a node whose literals `α` satisfies are the same edge.

This is the operational content of `Deterministic` — the reason it deserves the name — and
it is recorded here so that the predicate is visibly not vacuous.  Nothing below uses it:

/-! ## The imported upper bound -/

/-- **The Oztok–Darwiche compilation bound** [IMPORTED — Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche,
*On compiling CNF into decision-DNNF*, CP 2014, Theorem 1], quoted by Razgon at
[Raz16, §7]:

> the space complexity of decision-DNNF on a CNF formula with primal graph treewidth `t` is
> `O(2^t n)`.

Stated for the formulas this area actually has: `φ(G)`, whose primal graph is `G` itself.
The `O(·)` is unfolded into the two parameters `mulConst` and `addConst`, so that a
downstream theorem relates the constants it is given to the constants it produces, with no
asymptotic notation anywhere (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5).

The circuit is required to be a *decision-DNNF* (`IsDecisionDNNF`) and to compute `φ(G)`
stated as an `iff` on `C.eval` rather than through a `decide`, so that no decidability
instance for `phi` has to be produced at the interface.

See the module docstring for why this is a `structure` and not an `axiom`, for what would
discharge it, and for the non-vacuity witness `oztokDarwiche_witness`. -/
structure OztokDarwiche (V : Type*) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (mulConst addConst : ℕ) where

      C.size ≤ mulConst * (2 ^ t * Fintype.card V) + addConst

/-- **`OztokDarwiche` is inhabited**, on two variables, with `mulConst = 0` and
`addConst = 7`.

There are exactly two graphs on two vertices.  The empty one has `φ(G) ≡ ⊤`, handled by
`constTrue`; the one with an edge has `φ(G) = x₀ ∨ x₁`, handled by `decisionOr`, a genuine
seven-node decision-DNNF with a decision node.  Both are within the constant bound `7`, so
the treewidth hypothesis is not needed and `mulConst` may be taken to be `0`.

*What this witness is not.*  Exactly as in the non-vacuity section of
`LowerBounds/Imported.lean`: it says nothing about the `2^t·n` growth, which is the
imported theorem of Oztok and Darwiche.  It is a consistency check on the *shape* of the
bundle — no field contradicts another, and in particular a decision-DNNF really can compute
a `φ(G)` — so that `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` is known to be conditional on a hypothesis about something
rather than about nothing. -/

/-- **Theorem `decisionDNNF_robp_separation`** ([Raz16, `separ2`]), in its general form:
for a graph `G` of treewidth at most `t`, the CNF `φ(G)` has

* a decision-DNNF with at most `mulConst·(2^t·|V|) + addConst` nodes, and
* no ROBP with fewer than `lowerBound` nodes.

Both halves are relative to explicit hypotheses, and that is the point of the statement:
the upper bound comes from the imported bundle `OD` (Oztok–Darwiche, CP 2014, Theorem 1)
and the treewidth input `htw`, and the lower bound comes from `hLower`, which is Razgon's
own `two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` and is discharged in `BranchingPrograms/Separation.lean`.  No asymptotics
appear on either side.

The ROBP half is `hLower` with a determinism hypothesis added and immediately dropped: an
ROBP is a special case of an NROBP (`ROBP.size_ge_of_nrobp`, [Raz16, §7]).  The reason the
theorem is interesting is the *gap* between the two numbers, which `decisionDNNF_robp_separation_quintic`
exhibits for `T_r(P_{2r})`: polynomial against quasi-polynomial. -/

/-- **`decisionDNNF_robp_separation` for the class `T_r(P_{2p})`** — the graphs of Razgon's Lemma `binTreePathNumVertices_rpow_le_size`
([Raz16, `separ`]), a complete binary tree of height `r` with a path
on `2p` vertices at every node.

The treewidth input is discharged by `TreeProduct.treewidthLe_binTree_boxProd`, which gives
`tw ≤ 2·(2p) − 1`, and the vertex count by `TreeProduct.card_binTree_boxProd`.  So the
decision-DNNF bound is fully explicit in `r` and `p`:

`mulConst·(2^{4p−1}·(2^{r+1} − 1)·2p) + addConst`.

The paper names the class `φ(T_r(P_r))` in the statement of `decisionDNNF_robp_separation` but computes with
`T_r(P_{2r})` in both proofs; `p` is left free here and specialized to `p = r` in

/-- **Theorem `decisionDNNF_robp_separation`, as the paper states it** ([Raz16, `separ2`]):
on the class `φ(T_r(P_{2r}))`, decision-DNNF is polynomial while every ROBP is large.

With `n = (2^{r+1} − 1)·2r` the number of variables and `1 ≤ r`:

* there is a decision-DNNF for `φ(T_r(P_{2r}))` with at most `mulConst·(16·n⁵) + addConst`
  nodes — the paper's `O(n⁵)`;
* every uniform read-once ROBP realising it has at least `lowerBound` nodes, whatever
  `lowerBound` the hypothesis `hLower` supplies; `Razgon.two_rpow_le_size_binTree_pathGraph` supplies
  `⌈2^{((r+1−⌈log₂ r⌉)·r/2)/f(5)}⌉₊`, which is the paper's `n^{Ω(log n)}`.

Razgon's derivation of the exponent `5` is `t ≤ 4r ≤ 4 log n + 4` "for a sufficiently large
`r`".  Here the second inequality is proved for *every* `r ≥ 1`, from `2^{r+1} ≤ n`: the
tree alone contributes `2^{r+1} − 1` vertices and each carries at least two path vertices.
The hypothesis `1 ≤ r` is genuinely needed — at `r = 0` the graph has no vertices at all
and `n = 0`.

This is the assembled statement `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §8.4 item 1 asks for.  It remains conditional
on exactly two things, both visible in the binders: the imported Oztok–Darwiche bound `OD`,
and the NROBP lower bound `hLower`. -/
