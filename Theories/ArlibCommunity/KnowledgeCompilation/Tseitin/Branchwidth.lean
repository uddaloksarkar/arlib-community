# Branch decompositions and branchwidth

Third module of `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, formalizing the graph measure the
DNNF lower bound is stated in: §2 of Florent de Colnet and Stefan Mengel,
*Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular resolution refutations*
([dCM21, §2]).

## Branch decompositions reuse v-trees

A *branch decomposition* of `G` is a full binary tree whose leaves are in
bijection with the **edges** of `G` ([dCM21, §2]).  That is
exactly a well-formed `VTree` over the leaf type `{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet}` whose leaf
set is all of `E(G)` — so we reuse `Circuits/VTree.lean` rather than defining a new
tree, with `T.WellFormed` giving the leaf bijection and `T.vars = univ` giving
"all edges appear".

Each edge of the decomposition tree partitions `E(G)` into the two sides of the
tree it separates; this is exactly a subtree `s` and its complement.  The *order*
of that cut is the number of vertices of `G` incident to edges on **both** sides
([dCM21, §2]), and the *branchwidth* `bw(G)` is the minimum over decompositions of the
maximum order over cuts.

## The `…Le` convention

Following the area's lower/upper-bound-predicate style (cf.
`BranchingPrograms/TreeProduct.TreewidthLe` and `MatchingWidthGe`), we define the
upper-bound predicate `BranchwidthLe G k` — "some branch decomposition has every
cut of order `≤ k`" — rather than a numeric `bw` as a `sInf`, which would carry a
boundedness side condition at every use.

## Lemma 2 is imported

**Lemma 2** (`lemma:bw_vs_tw`, Harvey–Wood) — `bw(G) − 1 ≤ tw(G) ≤ (3/2)·bw(G)` for
`bw(G) ≥ 2` — is the bridge that lets the main result be stated in the more
familiar treewidth.  It is a genuine external theorem, carried as the `structure`
`Imported.HarveyWood` relating `BranchwidthLe` to
`BranchingPrograms.TreeProduct.TreewidthLe`.

/-! ## The order of a cut and branchwidth -/

/-- **The order of the cut induced by a subtree `s`** of a branch decomposition
([dCM21, §2]): the number of vertices of `G` incident to an
edge below `s` *and* to an edge not below `s`.  The subtree `s` picks out one side
`s.vars ⊆ E(G)` of the tree edge; the other side is its complement. -/

    (∃ e ∈ s.vars, v ∈ (e : Sym2 V)) ∧
    (∃ e ∈ Finset.univ \ s.vars, v ∈ (e : Sym2 V)))).card

/-- **`G` has branchwidth at most `k`** ([dCM21, §2]): some
branch decomposition — a well-formed v-tree over the edges whose leaves are exactly
`E(G)` — has every cut of order at most `k`.  The paper's `bw(G)` is the least such
`k`; this predicate is the form both a producer (an explicit decomposition) and a
consumer (a lower bound) want. -/

/-! ## Lemma 2: branchwidth versus treewidth — as an imported bridge -/

namespace Imported

/-- **`lemma:bw_vs_tw`** ([dCM21], Harvey–Wood
`[HW17, Lemma 12]`), as an imported hypothesis: for `bw(G) ≥ 2`,
`bw(G) − 1 ≤ tw(G) ≤ (3/2)·bw(G)`.  This is the bridge letting a branchwidth bound
be read as a treewidth bound (and back), stated here as the two implications
between `BranchwidthLe` and `TreeProduct.TreewidthLe` that a lower-bound argument
consumes:

* `tw ≤ (3/2)·bw`: a decomposition of order `≤ b` yields a tree decomposition of
  width `≤ ⌊3b/2⌋` (natural-number `3 * b / 2`; since `tw` is an integer bounded by
  the real `(3/2)b`, it is bounded by the floor);
* `bw − 1 ≤ tw`, i.e. `bw ≤ tw + 1`: a tree decomposition of width `≤ t` yields a
  branch decomposition of order `≤ t + 1`.

**Not proved and not inhabited here.**  Harvey–Wood is a genuine external theorem,
and a non-vacuity witness would have to construct, for a concrete graph, both a
branch decomposition (with its cut orders) *and* a tree decomposition realizing the
inequalities — which is the bookkeeping the import stands in for.  This is the
deliberate `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 exception (cf. `Imported.VertexSplitEquiv` in
`Splitting.lean`, `KnowledgeCompilation.Imported.SDDComplementation`): the
obstruction is stated, never an `axiom`. -/
