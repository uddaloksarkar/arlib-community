# Step 1: from an unsatisfiable refutation to a satisfiable DNNF

The reduction of §3 of Florent de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing
Tseitin-formulas with short regular resolution refutations*
([dCM21, §3.2]).  A regular refutation of an unsatisfiable
`T(G,c)` is turned, via a well-structured 1-BP, into a **DNNF for a satisfiable**
`T(G,c*)` of only polynomial overhead.

* **Lemma 11** (`lemma:from_well_struct_1BP_to_DNNF`) —
  `Imported.WellStructuredToDNNF`: a well-structured 1-BP of size `s` for
  `SearchVertex(G,c)` (with `G` connected, `T(G,c)` unsatisfiable, `T(G,c*)`
  satisfiable) yields a DNNF of size `≤ c₀·s·|V(G)|` computing `T(G,c*)`.
* **Theorem 5** (`theorem:from_refutation_to_sat_DNNF`) —
  `dnnfSizeLe_of_regRefutationLen`: **proved by composition** of Corollary 8,
  Lemma 10 and Lemma 11: a regular refutation of length `S` yields a DNNF of size
  `≤ c₀·S·|V(G)|` for the satisfiable `T(G,c*)`.

## Lemma 11 is boxed, not proved

Lemma 11's proof ([dCM21, §3.2]) is a reverse-topological induction over the 1-BP:
each node `u_i` computing `SearchVertex(G_i,c_i)` is assigned a gate computing the
*satisfiable* `T(G_i, c_i+1_v)`, decision nodes add `≤ 3|V_k|` `∨`/`∧`-gates, and
decomposability holds because the two sides of a split share no edge.  This is a
heavy induction on a BP model the repository does not build (the opaque
`HasWS1BPForSearchVertexLe` carrier of `Search.lean`), so following `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md`
§1.3 it is a boxed import with the **explicit** `c₀·s·|V|` size field — the honest
quantitative content — and is un-inhabited (inhabiting = the induction itself).
The `|D_k| ≤ 3(|V_1|+…+|V_S|)` bound of [dCM21, §3.2] is why the constant is a single `c₀`
with a factor `|V|`.

Theorem 5 itself is **proved**: it is exactly the composition
`refutation → 1-BP (Cor 8) → well-structured (Lem 10) → DNNF (Lem 11)`, and the
charge transfer to an arbitrary satisfiable `c*` is `Imported.ReduceToZeroCharge`
of `ThreeConnected.lean` (Lemma 6).

/-- **`theorem:from_refutation_to_sat_DNNF`**
([dCM21, `theorem:from_refutation_to_sat_DNNF`]), **proved by composition**: for an
unsatisfiable `T(G,c)` with `G` connected, a regular resolution refutation of
length `S` yields a DNNF of size at most `c₀·S·|V(G)|` computing the satisfiable
`T(G,c*)`.

The proof is the chain `Imported.RefutationToOneBP` (Corollary 8: refutation → 1-BP
of size `≤ S`), `Imported.OneBPToWellStructured` (Lemma 10: → a well-structured
one), `Imported.WellStructuredToDNNF` (Lemma 11: → a DNNF of size
`≤ c₀·S·|V|`). -/
