# Regular resolution

Part of Step 1 of `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, formalizing the resolution
vocabulary of §3 of Florent de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing
Tseitin-formulas with short regular resolution refutations*
([dCM21, §2]).

A **resolution refutation** of a CNF `F` derives the empty clause from the clauses
of `F` by the resolution rule; its **length** is the number of derived clauses,
and this is the quantity the main theorem lower-bounds.  A refutation is
**regular** when, on every directed path of its derivation DAG, no variable is
resolved twice ([dCM21, §2]).

The definitions here are generic (over any variable type and clause list), and
self-contained — no `Tseitin`-specific CNF encoding is built, since Step 1 only
ever consumes the *length* of a refutation.

resolvent of two *earlier* clauses, and the empty clause `∅` is derived.  The
`parent` field records the derivation DAG and the resolved variable of each
resolution step, which is what regularity is stated on. -/
