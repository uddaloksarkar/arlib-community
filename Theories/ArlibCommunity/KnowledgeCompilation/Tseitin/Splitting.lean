# Splitting parity constraints

Second module of `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, following §5 of Florent
de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular
resolution refutations* ([dCM21, §5]).  A rectangle for an
edge-partition *splits* a parity constraint `χ_v` into two sub-constraints in
disjoint variables, and this splitting is mirrored in the graph by *vertex
splitting*.  The pay-off is a count of the models a sub-constraint removes, which
feeds the adversarial-rectangle DNNF lower bound of §6.

## What is proved here, and what is imported

* **Sub-constraint** (`chiSub`, `IsSubConstraintIndex`, [dCM21, §5.1]) and **Lemma 15**
  (`rectangle_induces_subConstraint`, `lemma:rectangle_sub_constraints`)
  are **proved in full**.  Lemma 15 is a clean rectangle argument: a rectangle
  contained in `sat(T(G,c))` whose partition cuts a vertex `v` forces every
  member to share the parity of the `E₁`-incident edges at `v`.

* **Vertex splitting** (`NeighborPartition`, `splitGraph`, `splitCharge`, [dCM21, §5.2])
  is **defined**: splitting `v` along a proper neighbour-partition `(N₁, N₂)` is
  modelled on `V ⊕ Unit`, keeping `v` as `v¹` (now adjacent only to `N₁`) and
  adding `v² = Sum.inr ()` adjacent to `N₂`, so `|V'| = |V| + 1`.

* **Lemmas 16, 17, 18, 19** rest on the graph surgery of vertex splitting (an
  edge-variable renaming bijection across two different edge types, [dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_equals_subconstraint`]), a
  GF(2)-rank/model-count fact ([dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_to_connected_equals_half_models`], [dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_a_lot_to_connected_equals_far_less_models`]), and a spanning-tree + handshaking
  argument in `3`-connected graphs ([dCM21, `lemma:choose_vertices_from_3-connected_graph`]).  None is provable in Mathlib
  without machinery the area does not build (the incidence-matrix rank, a finite
  spanning tree with a leaf).  Following `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 each is carried as a
  named `structure` with **explicit counts** and threaded, and each is inhabited
  by a concrete witness at the foot of the file so the conditionals are not
  vacuous.  See the docstring of each bundle for its exact obstruction.

/-- **A sub-constraint of `χ_v`** as a predicate: the parity of the edge variables
in a set `S` equals `c₁`.  A genuine *sub-constraint* additionally requires `S` to
be a non-empty proper subset of the edges incident to `v` (`IsSubConstraintIndex`).

/-- **A (combinatorial) rectangle** for the edge-partition `(E₁, E₂ = E₁ᶜ)`: a set
of assignments closed under exchanging the `E₁`-part between two members.  The
hybrid `fun e => if e ∈ E₁ then α e else β e` takes its `E₁` values from `α` and
its `E₂` values from `β`; membership is closed under forming it
([dCM21, §5.1]). -/

    (R : Assignment G → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ α β, R α → R β → R (fun e => if e ∈ E₁ then α e else β e)

/-- **`lemma:rectangle_sub_constraints`**
([dCM21, `lemma:rectangle_sub_constraints`]).  Let `T(G,c)` be satisfiable and let `R` be a
rectangle for the edge-partition `(E₁, E₂)` with `R ⊆ sat(T(G,c))`.  If a vertex
`v` is incident both to edges in `E₁` and to edges in `E₂`, then `E₁(v) := E(v) ∩ E₁`
is the index of a genuine sub-constraint of `χ_v`, and there is a charge `c₁` such
that every member of `R` satisfies both `T(G,c)` and the sub-constraint
`∑_{e ∈ E₁(v)} x_e = c₁`.

The parity `c₁` is forced: if two members differed on the parity of `E₁(v)`, the
hybrid keeping one member's `E₁`-part and the other's `E₂`-part would falsify `χ_v`
while lying in `R ⊆ sat(T(G,c))`. -/

/-! ## Vertex splitting ([dCM21, §5.2])

Splitting `v` along a proper partition `(N₁, N₂)` of its neighbourhood: delete
`v`, add `v¹, v²`, join `v¹` to `N₁` and `v²` to `N₂`.  We model this on
`V ⊕ Unit`, *keeping* `v` as `v¹ = Sum.inl v` (now adjacent only to `N₁`, its
`N₂`-edges deleted) and adding `v² = Sum.inr ()` adjacent to `N₂`.  This is
faithful (`|V'| = |V| + 1`, matching delete-one-add-two) and avoids re-indexing
the whole vertex type. -/

/-! ## Graph-side lemmas — as inhabited imports

Lemmas 16–19 rest on graph surgery, a GF(2)-rank/model-count fact, and a
spanning-tree argument that Mathlib does not support cheaply.  Following
`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 they are carried as named `structure`s in the area's `Imported`
namespace with **explicit counts**, and (where a witness is cheaper than the
imported theorem) inhabited below. -/

namespace Imported

/-- **`lemma:graph_splitting_equals_subconstraint`**
([dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_equals_subconstraint`]), as an imported hypothesis:
splitting `v` along `(N₁, N₂)` with charges `c₁ + c₂ = c(v)` produces `T(G', c')`
whose models are in bijection — via the edge-variable renaming `ρ` of the
paper — with the models of `T(G, c) ∧ χ¹_v`, where `χ¹_v` is the sub-constraint on
the edges from `v` to `N₁` (index `S`).  Recorded here at the level of the model
counts these renamings identify.

**Not proved and not inhabited here.**  The renaming `ρ` is a bijection between two
*different* edge-variable types (`E(G')` and `E(G)`), and exhibiting it together
with the per-vertex constraint matching *is* the imported content; a non-vacuity
witness would have to construct the same bijection.  This is the deliberate
exception `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 allows (cf.
`KnowledgeCompilation.Imported.SDDComplementation`): the obstruction is stated,
not hidden behind an `axiom`. -/

/-- **Lemmas 17 and 18** ([dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_to_connected_equals_half_models`], [dCM21, `lemma:graph_splitting_a_lot_to_connected_equals_far_less_models`],
`lemma:graph_splitting_to_connected_equals_half_models` and its `k`-fold
generalization `..._far_less_models`), as an imported hypothesis with an explicit
count.

For a satisfiable connected `T(G, c)`, an independent set `{v₁, …, v_k}` with a
sub-constraint `χ'_{v_i}` (index `Ssub i`, charge `charges i`) at each, if the
graph obtained by splitting all `v_i` stays connected (`splitAllConnected`), then

  `#{α : T(G,c) ∧ ⋀_i χ'_{v_i}}` = `2^{|E| − |V| − k + 1}`,

stated multiplicatively as `2^{|E| + 1} = #models · 2^{|V| + k}` to avoid
truncated subtraction.  Lemma 17 is the case `k = 1`.

The obstruction is the same GF(2)-incidence-rank fact behind Proposition 4
(`Imported.TseitinModelCount` in `Basic.lean`): the `k` sub-constraints are
linearly independent from the vertex constraints exactly when the split stays
connected.  Inhabited at
`k = 0`, where the statement is Proposition 4 for a connected graph. -/

/-- **`lemma:choose_vertices_from_3-connected_graph`**
([dCM21, `lemma:choose_vertices_from_3-connected_graph`]), as an imported hypothesis.  If `G`
is `3`-connected and `{v₁, …, v_k}` is an independent set with a proper
neighbour-partition at each `v_i`, then some subset `S` of the indices with
`k ≤ 3·|S|` (i.e. `|S| ≥ k/3`) can be split while keeping `G` connected.

The predicate `KeepsConnected : Finset (Fin k) → Prop` abstracts "the graph
obtained by splitting exactly the `v_i` for `i ∈ ·` is connected"; the downstream
caller instantiates it with the iterated split graph.

The obstruction is the paper's spanning-tree + handshaking argument ([dCM21, §5.3])
over the contraction `G₃` of the split components: it needs a finite spanning tree
with `r − 1` edges, which rests on the "a finite tree has a leaf" induction absent
from Mathlib (area `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-Tseitin-ROADMAP.md` §9.3).  Inhabited at `k = 0` (`S = ∅`). -/
