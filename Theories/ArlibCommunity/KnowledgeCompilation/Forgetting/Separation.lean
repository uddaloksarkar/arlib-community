# An exponential separation by forgetting a single variable (`thm:sep`)

Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche, *On Compiling DNNFs without Determinism*
(§4, [OD17, `thm:sep`]).  This file formalizes the paper's main
theoretical separation: there are classes `f_n` and `g_n(·, Z)` with `f_n`
equivalent modulo forgetting `Z` to `g_n`, such that **every** d-DNNF for `f_n` is
exponential while **some** d-DNNF for `g_n` is polynomial.  Forgetting the single
auxiliary variable `Z` from the compact d-DNNF for `g_n` yields a compact
(non-deterministic) DNNF for `f_n`, which no d-DNNF can match.

## The concrete functions ([OD17, §4])

Over an `n × n` Boolean matrix `M` the paper builds:

* `h_n(v)` = "the number of `1`s among the inputs `v` is divisible by 3"
  (`divBy3`);
* `row_n(M) = ⊕ᵢ h_n(Rᵢ)`, the XOR over rows (`rowFn`); `col_n` over columns
  (`colFn`);
* `f_n(M) = row_n(M) ∨ col_n(M)` — the **Sauerhoff function** (`sauerhoffFn`);
* `g_n(M, Z) = (Z ∧ row_n(M)) ∨ (¬Z ∧ col_n(M))` (`gFun`).

The Sauerhoff function is exactly the one Bova–Capelli–Mengel–Slivovsky used to
separate DNNF from d-DNNF, and that is what supplies clause (ii).

## What is *proved here* versus imported

The **heart of this file, proved unconditionally, is
`equivModForget_sauerhoffFn_gFun`**: `f_n ≡ ∃Z. g_n`.  The proof is entirely
structural and turns on one fact — that `row_n` and `col_n` read only the matrix
variables, never `Z`.  Given an assignment `α`, its extension with `Z := true`
makes `g_n` equal to `row_n(α)`
and with `Z := false` equal to `col_n(α)`; so `∃Z. g_n` fires iff
`row_n(α) ∨ col_n(α) = f_n(α)`.  Since `EquivModForget` in `Forgetting.Basic` is
*definitionally* `f(α) ↔ ∃β≡α off Y. g(β)`, this is the whole content, and by
`equivModForget_iff_eq_forgetFun` it upgrades to the equation
`f_n = forgetFun {Z} g_n` (`sauerhoffFn_eq_forgetFun`).  The internal shape of
`h_n` — divisibility by 3, parity of the XOR — is *irrelevant* to this proof, and
is never unfolded; it is defined faithfully only so that the classes are the
paper's.

The **two quantitative facts the paper imports and does not prove** are carried as
`structure` bundles with explicit numeric bounds, exactly in the style of
`LowerBounds/Imported.lean` (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3), never as `axiom`s:

* `SauerhoffdDNNFLowerBound n` — clause (ii), Bova–Capelli–Mengel–Slivovsky: every
  d-DNNF computing `f_n` has at least `bound` nodes, where the intended `bound` is
  exponential in `n`.
* `GndDNNFUpperBound n` — clause (iii): `row_n`, `col_n` have polynomial OBDDs (a
  subset of d-DNNF), so `g_n` has a d-DNNF of at most `bound` nodes, `bound`
  polynomial in `n`.

Both bundles are **inhabited** (`sauerhoffdDNNFLowerBound_witness`,
`gndDNNFUpperBound_witness`), so the conditional `thm:sep` is provably not
vacuous.  The lower-bound witness is minimal (`bound = 1`, true because every NNF
has a root and hence at least one node) and asserts nothing about the exponential
content — that is the imported theorem.  The upper-bound witness is at `n = 0`,
where `g_0` collapses to the constant `⊥` and a one-node circuit suffices; that a
single instance is inhabited is all a non-vacuity check needs (compare the
degenerate two-variable witnesses of `LowerBounds/Imported.lean`).

## Adjoining the fresh variable

`M` ranges over `Fin n × Fin n` and `Z` is a single fresh variable, so the ambient
variable type is `SepVar n := (Fin n × Fin n) ⊕ Unit`, with `Z = Sum.inr ()` and
the matrix entry `M(i,j) = α (Sum.inl (i,j))`.  This is the `Sum` idiom the module
docstring of `Forgetting.Basic` points at for adjoining one variable; the forgotten
set is the singleton `{Z}`, matching the paper's "forgetting a single auxiliary
variable".

## The corollary ([OD17, §4])

`exists_dDNNF_gFun_hard_forget` packages the separation as the paper's corollary:
d-DNNF (and FBDD) do not support polynomial-time single-variable forgetting.  It
exhibits the compact d-DNNF for `g_n` whose `{Z}`-forgetting computes `f_n`, together with the
fact that any d-DNNF for that forgotten function is large — so the forgetting
operation cannot be a polynomial-size d-DNNF-to-d-DNNF map.

/-- **`f_n` is equivalent modulo forgetting `Z` to `g_n`** (§4):
`f_n(M) ≡ ∃Z. g_n(M, Z)`.

The two directions of `EquivModForget` (definition in `Forgetting.Basic`, [OD17, §5.3]):

* If `f_n(α) = row_n(α) ∨ col_n(α)` is `true`, one of the disjuncts holds; extend
  `α` by setting `Z` to `true` (if `row_n`) or `false` (if `col_n`).  The
  extension agrees with `α` off `{Z}`, and by `rowFn_congr`/`colFn_congr` makes
  the matching disjunct of `g_n` fire.
* Conversely any `β` agreeing with `α` off `{Z}` has `row_n(β) = row_n(α)` and
  `col_n(β) = col_n(α)`, so `g_n(β) = true` forces one of `row_n(α)`, `col_n(α)`,
  hence `f_n(α)`. -/

/-! ## The two imported quantitative facts, as hypothesis bundles

Neither is proved by the paper; both are carried as `structure`s with an explicit
numeric bound, in the style of `LowerBounds/Imported.lean` (`docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.3), so
that `forgetting_separation` visibly rests on exactly these two hypotheses and on
nothing else.  Both are inhabited below, so the conditional is not vacuous. -/

/-- **Clause (ii) — the d-DNNF lower bound for the Sauerhoff function**
(Bova–Capelli–Mengel–Slivovsky, imported via §4, [OD17]).

Every d-DNNF computing `f_n` has at least `bound` nodes; the imported theorem
supplies a `bound` exponential in `n`.  Following `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5 the bound is an
explicit parameter rather than an asymptotic assertion, so a downstream statement
relates the number it is given to the number it produces.

**Not to be proved here** — it is the Bova–Capelli–Mengel–Slivovsky separation of
DNNF from d-DNNF, a substantial paper in its own right, and it carries the entire
quantitative content of the separation. -/

/-- **Clause (iii) — the polynomial d-DNNF for `g_n`** (§4: `row_n` and
`col_n` have polynomial OBDDs, a subset of d-DNNF, so `g_n` does too).

The data is the compact d-DNNF itself, of at most `bound` nodes with `bound`
polynomial in `n`.  As with the lower bound, `bound` is an explicit parameter.

**Not proved here** — the OBDD construction of Bryant for the divisibility/parity
functions and their combination into a d-DNNF for `g_n` is the imported content;
compare `Imported.SDDComplementation`, which is likewise a construction demanded of
the import rather than a shape check. -/

/-- **`SauerhoffdDNNFLowerBound` is inhabited**, for every `n`, with the minimal
bound `1`: every NNF has a root and hence at least one node, so `1 ≤ |C|` for
*any* circuit, d-DNNF or not.  This says nothing about the exponential content —
that is the imported theorem — but it establishes that the hypothesis is about
something rather than being jointly unsatisfiable. -/

constant-`⊥` circuit is a d-DNNF (it has no `∧`- or `∨`-node) computing `g_0`.
A single inhabited instance is all a non-vacuity check needs; the interesting

/-! ## The separation theorem and its corollary

The capstone `forgetting_separation` below is a three-clause conjunction, so each
of its clauses is available on its own first: clause (i) is
`equivModForget_sauerhoffFn_gFun`, clause (ii) is
`bound_le_size_of_computes_sauerhoffFn` and clause (iii) is
`exists_dDNNF_gFun_size_le`.  The capstone is then literally the triple of the
three, and no consumer ever has to destructure it. -/

/-- **Clause (ii) of `thm:sep`, on its own**: every d-DNNF computing `f_n` has at
least `lb.bound` nodes.  This is the imported lower bound read out of its bundle,
named so that a caller who wants only this half never touches the conjunction. -/
theorem bound_le_size_of_computes_sauerhoffFn {n : ℕ} (lb : SauerhoffdDNNFLowerBound n) :
    ∀ C : NNF (SepVar n), C.IsdDNNF → C.Computes (sauerhoffFn n) → lb.bound ≤ C.size :=
  lb.hard

/-- **Clause (iii) of `thm:sep`, on its own**: some d-DNNF computes `g_n` with at
most `ub.bound` nodes.  This is the imported upper bound read out of its bundle,
named for the same reason as `bound_le_size_of_computes_sauerhoffFn`. -/
theorem exists_dDNNF_gFun_size_le {n : ℕ} (ub : GndDNNFUpperBound n) :
    ∃ C : NNF (SepVar n), C.IsdDNNF ∧ C.Computes (gFun n) ∧ C.size ≤ ub.bound :=
  ub.witness

/-- **`thm:sep`** (§4, [OD17]).

Conditional on the two imported bundles, the three clauses of the paper's theorem
hold simultaneously for the concrete classes `f_n = sauerhoffFn n` and `g_n = gFun n`:

* **(i)** `f_n` is equivalent modulo forgetting `Z` to `g_n` — proved
  unconditionally, `equivModForget_sauerhoffFn_gFun`;
* **(ii)** every d-DNNF computing `f_n` has at least `lb.bound` nodes —
  `bound_le_size_of_computes_sauerhoffFn`;
* **(iii)** some d-DNNF computes `g_n` with at most `ub.bound` nodes —
  `exists_dDNNF_gFun_size_le`.

With `lb.bound` exponential and `ub.bound` polynomial (the intended instantiations
of the imports) this is the exponential separation: no compact d-DNNF for `f_n`,
yet a compact d-DNNF for `g_n` from which forgetting the single variable `Z`
recovers `f_n`.

This statement is a convenience: it is exactly the triple of the three named
clauses above, and it is derived from them. -/

    exists_dDNNF_gFun_size_le ub⟩

/-- **The corollary** (§4): d-DNNF (and FBDD) do not support polynomial-time
single-variable forgetting.

The compact d-DNNF `C` for `g_n` witnesses the failure: forgetting the single
variable `Z` from `C` computes `forgetFun {Z} C.eval = f_n`
(`sauerhoffFn_eq_forgetFun`), yet **every** d-DNNF for that forgotten function has at
least `lb.bound` nodes.  So no polynomial-size d-DNNF-to-d-DNNF forgetting operation
can exist: it would turn the `≤ ub.bound`-node `C` into a `≥ lb.bound`-node result,
and `lb.bound` is exponential while `ub.bound` is polynomial. -/
