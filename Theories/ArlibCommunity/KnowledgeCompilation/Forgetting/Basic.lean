# Forgetting variables on a DNNF, and equivalence modulo forgetting

Umut Oztok and Adnan Darwiche, *On Compiling DNNFs without Determinism*
([OD17]).  This file is the heart of that paper: the
linear-time forgetting operation on a decomposable NNF, and the equivalence
relation — *equivalence modulo forgetting* — that the compilation algorithm is
built on.

## What the paper says, and what it does not say

The paper's algorithm (`alg:dnnf`) compiles a DNNF for `f(X)` in three
steps: find a `g(X,Y)` that `f` is *equivalent modulo forgetting* to, compile `g`
to a **deterministic** DNNF with an off-the-shelf compiler, then forget `Y`.  The
whole method rests on one sentence, at [OD17, §3]:

> This is due to the property of decomposability, which supports linear time
> multiple-variable forgetting: all one needs is to replace auxiliary variables
> with the constant `⊤` in the structure.

That is `forgetNNF` below, and `forgetNNF_spec` is the sentence made into a
theorem.  The paper gives no argument for it, so the rest of this docstring
supplies one — in particular it locates precisely where decomposability enters,
because the statement is *false* without it and the paper never says why.

## Where decomposability is used

Write `Δ` for the input circuit and `Δ^⊤` for the result of replacing every
literal of a `Y`-variable by the constant `⊤`.  The claim is

`Δ^⊤(α) = 1  ⟺  ∃ β agreeing with α off Y, Δ(β) = 1`.

**The `⇐` direction is free.**  Replacing a literal by `⊤` can only raise the
value of a node — an NNF is negation-free, so every gate is monotone in its
inputs — and a `Y`-literal that `β` happens to satisfy was already `⊤`-like.  So
`Δ(β) = 1` implies `Δ^⊤(α) = 1` for *any* NNF whatever.  This is
`valAt_forgetNNF_of_valAt`, and it mentions decomposability nowhere.

**The `⇒` direction is where the property is consumed**, and it is consumed at
exactly one place: the `∧`-node, in `exists_of_valAt_forgetNNF`.  The induction
hypothesis at a node says "if `Δ^⊤` fires here then *some* assignment to the
`Y`-variables makes `Δ` fire here".  At `i = j ∧ k` the two children hand back
two witnesses `β₁` and `β₂`, each agreeing with `α` off `Y` but possibly
disagreeing with each other *on* `Y`; to conclude anything about `i` one must
merge them into a single assignment.  Decomposability is what makes the merge
exist: `var(j)` and `var(k)` are disjoint, so

`β := fun x => if x ∈ var(j) then β₁ x else β₂ x`

agrees with `β₁` throughout `var(j)` and with `β₂` throughout `var(k)`, and
`NNF.valAt_congr` — the workhorse that says a node sees only the variables below
it — turns those agreements into `Δ(β) = 1` at both children.

Drop decomposability and the theorem is false, with a two-line counterexample:
take `g = y ∧ ¬y` and `Y = {y}`.  Substituting `⊤` gives `⊤ ∧ ⊤ ≡ ⊤`, whereas
`∃y. (y ∧ ¬y) ≡ ⊥`.  The offending `∧`-node is precisely one whose two children
share the variable `y`, i.e. the one decomposability forbids.  So the hypothesis
is not an artefact of the proof: it is the exact boundary of the claim.

## What is lost

Determinism, and this is the point of the paper rather than a defect.  The dual
counterexample is `y ∨ ¬y`, a perfectly good d-DNNF: its `∨`-node is
deterministic because the two children are inconsistent with each other.  Forget
`y` and it becomes `⊤ ∨ ⊤`, whose `∨`-node is as non-deterministic as possible.
That circuit is `forgetDetExample` below, and `not_deterministic_forgetDetExample`
is the formal statement that `forgetNNF` does not preserve `NNF.Deterministic`.
Decomposability, by contrast, is preserved (`decomposable_forgetNNF`), because
`var` only shrinks: `var_{Δ^⊤}(i) = var_Δ(i) \ Y` exactly (`varsAt_forgetNNF`).

## The size relation

`forgetNNF` changes labels and nothing else — the node set, the child relation
and the root are untouched — so the size relation is an **equality**,
`size_forgetNNF : (forgetNNF C Y).size = C.size`, which is stronger than the "no
larger" the task asks for and is what makes the step linear time.  Note that
this is a statement about the DAG, in the sense of `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §1.1: no node is
duplicated, so no sharing is lost.

## Design notes

*The set of forgotten variables is a `Finset V`, not a fresh summand.*
`Circuits/DNFMux.lean` quantifies a *single* fresh variable of `V ⊕ Unit` and
lands back in `(V → Bool) → Bool` by an honest change of type.  That is the right
idiom there, where exactly one variable is ever introduced.  Here the paper
forgets an arbitrary set `Y` in one sweep — that is the content of "multiple
variable forgetting" — and there is no type-level way to say "these `k` of the
variables".  So `Y : Finset V`, and the semantics of forgetting is stated as
`∃ β, (∀ x ∉ Y, β x = α x) ∧ …`, an existential over assignments that may differ
from `α` only inside `Y`.  `Forgetting.Separation` bridges the two idioms
(`Separation.equivModForget_sauerhoffFn_gFun`, whose ambient type is `V ⊕ Unit` and
whose forgotten set is the singleton `{Sum.inr ()}`).

*Forgetting is a semantic notion, so `forgetFun` is `noncomputable`.*  The
existential over `V → Bool` is not decidable for infinite `V`, and making the
definition computable would mean carrying a `Fintype V` through the whole file
for no gain: every consumer uses `forgetFun_eq_true_iff`, never a computation.

*No `Sat`/`Models` layer.*  Everything is stated on `NNF.eval`/`NNF.valAt`
directly, matching the rest of `Circuits/`.

The node set, the child relation and the root are literally the input's, so this
is a linear-time pass over the structure and the size relation is an equality
(`size_forgetNNF`).  It computes `∃Y. g` **only** when the input is decomposable;
see the module docstring for exactly where that is used and for the
counterexample without it.

Marked `@[reducible]` so that `(forgetNNF C Y).size` and `C.size` — equal by
`rfl`, since the node set is literally the input's — are also interchangeable at
`simp`/`rw` transparency; otherwise every lemma indexed by `Fin C.size` fails to

If the substituted node fires under `α`, then some assignment `β` differing from
`α` only inside `Y` makes the *original* node fire.

The `∧`-case is the entire content.  The two children return witnesses `β₁`, `β₂`
that may disagree on `Y`, and they are merged by cutting along `var(j)`:
decomposability says `var(j)` and `var(k)` are disjoint, so the merged assignment
agrees with `β₁` on all of `var(j)` and with `β₂` on all of `var(k)`, and
`NNF.valAt_congr` transports both values.  Without disjointness the two witnesses
can be irreconcilable — `y ∧ ¬y` with `Y = {y}` — and the statement is false. -/

The paper's §3: "What is crucial here is that the resulting structure does
not enforce determinism anymore, but the decomposability property stays intact."
The second half is `decomposable_forgetNNF`; the first half is an existence
statement and needs a witness, which is the three-node d-DNNF `y ∨ ¬y`. -/

is `¬y`, node `2` is their disjunction and is the source. -/

`f(X) ≡ ∃Y. g(X,Y)`.

The paper's disjointness of `X` and `Y` is not a side condition here, it is a
*consequence*: the right-hand side manifestly does not look at `α` inside `Y`, so
`EquivModForget` forces `f` not to either (`equivModForget_indep`).  Carrying an
explicit `X` would add a hypothesis that says nothing extra. -/

/-- **Algorithm 1 returns a DNNF representation of its input** (paper
Proposition, [OD17, §3]; the algorithm is at [OD17, `alg:dnnf`]).

The algorithm's three lines are its three hypotheses and its conclusion: line 1
produces a `g` with `EquivModForget Y f g`, line 2 produces a d-DNNF `C` computing
`g`, and line 3 is `forgetNNF C Y`.  What comes out is decomposable, computes `f`,
and has exactly as many nodes as what went in — but is not claimed deterministic, which
is the entire point (`not_deterministic_forgetDetExample`).

Note that only `C.IsDNNF` is used: the compiler of line 2 is asked for a d-DNNF
because that is what off-the-shelf compilers produce, not because forgetting
needs determinism. -/
