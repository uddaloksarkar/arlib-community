# The rectangle measures `Cov` and `Par`

The counting measures of the communication-complexity detour (paper §3,
[VS24, §3]; inventory D19, D21).  `Cov_b^Π(f)` is the
least number of `Π`-rectangles needed to cover `f⁻¹(b)`, `Par_b^Π(f)` the least
number needed to *partition* it, and the best-partition measures `Cov_b(f)`,
`Par_b(f)` minimise those over all balanced partitions `Π` of the variables.
The rectangle lemma will read a d-SDNNF of size `s` as a rectangular partition
of `f⁻¹(1)` into `s` pieces, giving `Par₁(f) ≤ s`; a lower bound on `Par₁`
is then a lower bound on circuit size.

## A predicate first, the minimum second

Each measure is built in two steps.  First a `Prop`-valued predicate
`HasCoverOfSize P f b k`, "`f⁻¹(b)` has a cover by `k` `Π`-rectangles"; then the
measure as the `sInf` of the `k` satisfying it.  The reason is that no proof in
the paper ever computes a minimum: an upper bound is always *"here is a cover"*
(`fixedCov_le_of_hasCover`) and a lower bound is always *"no cover of that size
exists"* (`not_hasCover_of_lt_fixedCov`).  Both directions are then one
application of `Nat.sInf_le` or `Nat.notMem_of_lt_sInf`, and the minimum itself
never has to be examined.

## The junk value, and how it is disposed of

`sInf` on `ℕ` is total: on the empty set it returns `0`.  So if `f⁻¹(b)` admits
no finite rectangle cover at all — possible here, since `V` may be infinite and
`f` is not required to depend on finitely many variables — then `Cov_b^Π(f)`
is `0` rather than `∞`.  Two consequences, and they are not symmetric.

*Upper bounds are unaffected.*  `fixedCov_le_of_hasCover` and the lower-bound
form `not_hasCover_of_lt_fixedCov` are both unconditional, and those are the two
lemmas that get used.

*Comparisons between two measures are affected.*  `Cov_b^Π(f) ≤ Par_b^Π(f)`
would be false if there were a cover but no partition, since the right-hand side
would be junk `0`; so `fixedCov_le_fixedPar` carries the hypothesis
`Partitionable`, and likewise for the best-partition versions.

In practice the hypothesis is free: `partitionable_of_dependsOn` shows that a
function depending only on the finite variable set `Z` — which is every function
the paper considers — has a rectangular partition of `f⁻¹(b)` with at most
`2 ^ |Z|` pieces, by taking one rectangle per assignment to `Z`.  That theorem
is also the trivial upper bound against which every lower bound in the area is
measured, so it is worth having independently of the junk-value question.  The
alternative — valuing the measures in `ℕ∞` — would put a `⊤` case into every
downstream arithmetic step to buy a lemma that is discharged once, here.

## Neither logarithms nor protocols

The paper immediately renames these measures logarithmically,
`NCC_b^Π(f) := log₂ Cov_b^Π(f)` and `UCC_b^Π(f) := log₂ Par_b^Π(f)`
([VS24, §3], [VS24, §A]), and identifies them with the cost of
non-deterministic and unambiguous two-party protocols.  Neither the logarithm
nor the protocol is formalized here, deliberately (inventory D20 and Part E).
Every quantitative statement in the paper is used in the exponentiated form
`Cov₀(f) = 2^{NCC₀(f)}`, so taking logarithms would introduce real numbers and
`Nat.log`-versus-`Real.logb` rounding questions in exchange for nothing; and the
protocol characterisation is cited to Kushilevitz–Nisan and used only as
intuition, so formalizing protocols would add a layer with no consumer.
Everything below stays in `ℕ`.

/-- **`Cov_b(f)`** (paper §3, [VS24]; inventory D21): the
least `k` such that *some* balanced partition of the variable set `Z` admits a
cover of `f⁻¹(b)` by `k` rectangles.

Two remarks on the encoding.

The paper writes `Cov_b(f) := min_Π Cov_b^Π(f)`.  Minimising over pairs
`(Π, k)`, as here, is the same thing whenever every balanced `Π` admits a finite
cover (`bestCov_le_fixedCov` is the comparison in the direction that always
holds), and is better behaved otherwise: a single partition admitting no cover
would contribute the junk value `0` to a literal `min_Π`, collapsing the
measure, whereas here it simply contributes nothing.

Passing `Z` explicitly, rather than reading it off `f`, is deliberate: `f` is a
predicate on total assignments and does not determine a finite variable set.  `Z`
is the paper's set of inputs of `f`, and the intended pairing is
`DependsOn f Z`. -/
noncomputable def bestCov (Z : Finset V) (f : (V → Bool) → Bool) (b : Bool) : ℕ :=
  sInf {k | ∃ P : VarPartition Z, P.Balanced ∧ HasCoverOfSize P f b k}

/-- **`Par_b(f)`** (paper §3, [VS24]; inventory D21): the
same minimum for rectangular partitions.  This is the measure bounded by the
rectangle lemma, `Par₁(f) ≤ s` for a d-SDNNF of size `s`. -/

    (h : HasPartitionOfSize P f b k) : bestPar Z f b ≤ k := Nat.sInf_le ⟨P, hP, h⟩

/-- **The unfolded lower-bound form, and the whole difficulty of the paper.**

A lower bound on the best-partition measure is a statement about *every*
balanced partition at once: if `k < Cov_b(f)` then no balanced `Π` whatsoever
admits a cover of `f⁻¹(b)` by `k` rectangles.  This is the form the lifting
argument of §4 has to establish, and the reason the fixed-partition hardness
theorem cannot be used directly.

Unconditional: no `Coverable` hypothesis, for the same reason as
`not_hasCover_of_lt_fixedCov`. -/

/-- The best-partition measure is at most the fixed-partition measure at any
balanced partition — the inequality `min_Π Cov_b^Π(f) ≤ Cov_b^Π(f)`.

`Coverable` is needed only to know that `fixedCov P f b` is a genuine cover size
and not the junk value. -/

/-- **The bridging lemma: a lower bound on the best-partition measure is a lower
bound at every fixed balanced partition.**

This is the form in which the best-partition measures are consumed downstream —
a bound `n ≤ Cov_b(f)` obtained from the lifting argument is applied at whatever
particular balanced partition the rectangle lemma happens to hand back. -/

partition of `f⁻¹(b)` for *any* partition `Π` of `Z`.  Discarded cells are
replaced by the empty rectangle rather than removed, which keeps the count a
clean power of two at the cost of a bound that is not tight.

Explicit rather than asymptotic, per `docs/dev/KnowledgeCompilation-ROADMAP.md` §5.  Its real job is to
discharge `Coverable`/`Partitionable` for every function the paper considers. -/
