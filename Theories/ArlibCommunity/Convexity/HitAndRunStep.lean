# Lemma 3.2 of Lovász–Vempala: the median hit-and-run step is at least `s_α/32`

This file proves **Lemma 3.2** of

> L. Lovász and S. Vempala, *Hit-and-Run from a Corner*, STOC 2004 / SIAM J. Comput. 35
> (2006) 985–1005, `https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/papers/start.pdf`

which bounds the step-length function `F` of the hit-and-run walk from below by the concave
function `s_α` of `Arlib/Convexity/StepLength.lean`:

> **Lemma 3.2.** If `α ≥ 63/64`, then for all `x ∈ K`, `F(x) ≥ s_α(x)/32`.

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.medianStepSet K x` — `{c : P(|x − y| ≤ c) > 1/8}`, the radii already carrying more
  than `1/8` of the one-step law.
* `Arlib.medianStep K x` — **the paper's `F(x)`**, the infimum of that set.

## Main results

* `Arlib.toSphere_mul_le_volume_of_cone` — **the cone bound**, the geometric engine: a set
  `D` of directions and a radial window `(a,b]` sweep out a set of volume at least
  `|D|·(bⁿ − aⁿ)/n`, where `|D|` is `Measure.toSphere D`.
* `Arlib.toSphere_badDir_le`, `Arlib.toSphere_badDir_neg_le` — **the paper's `p ≤ 1/32`**,
  for the two antipodal senses of "bad direction".
* `Arlib.hitAndRunProposal_closedBall_le` — **the paper's `P(|y − x| ≤ s/32) ≤ 1/8`**.
* `Arlib.stepRadius_le_medianStep` — **Lemma 3.2**, as `s_α(x) ≤ 32·F(x)`;
  `Arlib.stepRadius_div_le_medianStep` restates it as `F(x) ≥ s_α(x)/32`.
* `Arlib.hitAndRunProposal_univ_eq_one_of_mem_interior` — discharges the one inline
  hypothesis (see below) for a bounded body and an interior point.
* `Arlib.exists_stepRadius_le_medianStep_witness` — the non-vacuity witness.

## How `F` is defined, and against which kernel

`F` is defined against `Arlib.MarkovChains.hitAndRun`, *the* hit-and-run kernel of
`Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRun.lean`; no second notion of step length is
introduced.  The paper's equation (4) reads `P(|x − y| ≤ F(x)) = 1/8` and presupposes that
the law of `|x − y|` attains the value `1/8`.  We take instead the lower `1/8`-quantile

`F(x) = inf {c : P(|x − y| ≤ c) > 1/8}`,

which always exists (`medianStepSet_nonempty`, from the fact that `hitAndRun K x` is a
probability measure), is bounded below by `0`, and satisfies both defining inequalities:
`hitAndRun_closedBall_le_of_lt_medianStep` and `le_hitAndRun_closedBall_of_medianStep_lt`.
Where the paper's equation has a solution the two agree.

## The one inline hypothesis: `hmove`

`stepRadius_le_medianStep` carries `hmove : hitAndRunProposal K x univ = 1` — the walk moves
away from `x` with probability one.  This is **not removable**: `hitAndRun` has a lazy atom
at `x` absorbing the mass of the directions along which the chord through `x` is null or
infinite, and that atom sits at distance `0`, so a walk staying put with probability more
than `1/8` has `F(x) = 0` and Lemma 3.2 fails.  The paper never mentions the issue because
it silently works with an interior point of a bounded body.  Following the convention of
`HitAndRun.lean`, the hypothesis is an inline `∀`-free equation, **not** a named `Prop`, and
`hitAndRunProposal_univ_eq_one_of_mem_interior` discharges it whenever `ball x ε ⊆ K ⊆ RB`.

## Two findings about the paper

### 1. The printed bound `p ≤ 1 − α + 2⁻ⁿ ≤ 1/32` is invalid for `n ≤ 5`

The paper's proof sets `p` = the fraction of the sphere `∂(x + (s/2)B)` outside `K` and
writes

> `vol((x + sB) \ K) ≥ p·vol(sB) − vol((s/2)B)`,  hence  `p ≤ 1 − α + 2⁻ⁿ ≤ 1/32`.

The final `≤ 1/32` at `α ≥ 63/64` needs `2⁻ⁿ ≤ 1/64`, i.e. **`n ≥ 6`**, which the paper
never states.  So the displayed chain is a genuine gap for `n ≤ 5`.

**But Lemma 3.2 itself is true for every `n ≥ 1`, and that is what is proved here.**  The
gap is an artefact of a needless weakening: the cone swept out by the bad directions between
radii `s/2` and `s` has volume exactly `p·(vol(sB) − vol((s/2)B))`, and the paper throws away
the factor by weakening `p·(V − V/2ⁿ)` to `p·V − V/2ⁿ`.  Keeping it and comparing with
`vol((x+sB) \ K) ≤ (1−α)·vol(sB)` gives

`p ≤ (1 − α)/(1 − 2⁻ⁿ) ≤ 2(1 − α) ≤ 1/32`  for all `n ≥ 1`,

which is `Arlib.toSphere_badDir_le`.  This is why the theorems below carry `n ≠ 0` and no
other dimension hypothesis: the corrected proof needs none, so neither `n ≥ 6` nor a worse
constant nor a stronger `α` threshold had to be adopted.

### 2. The direction of the §4 chain — resolved, no bug

An earlier reading of §4 suspected that

`s(x) ≥ (|x−p|/|u−p|)·s(u) ≥ 32(|q−p|/|u−p|)·F(u)`

used Lemma 3.2 backwards.  It does not: **every relation in that chain is `≤`, not `≥`.**
The source reads

`s(x) ≤ (|x−p|/|u−p|)·s(u) ≤ 32(|q−p|/|u−p|)·F(u) ≤ 16√n·|u−v|·(|q−p|/|u−p|)`
`   = 16·d_K(u,v)·√n·|q−v| ≤ 16·d_K(u,v)·D√n`,

feeding `h(x) = s(x)/(48D√n) ≤ d_K(u,v)/3`, which is an **upper** bound on `s(x)` — exactly
the direction `s(u) ≤ 32·F(u)` supplies.  The first step is concavity used the correct way:
`u` lies between `p` and `x` on the chord, so `s(u) ≥ (|u−p|/|x−p|)·s(x)`, which is
`Arlib.theta_mul_stepRadius_le` of `Arlib/Convexity/StepLength.lean` with `θ = |u−p|/|x−p|`.
The earlier suspicion came from a lossy text extraction that dropped the `cmsy` relation
glyphs; re-extracting with the TeX math encoding resolves it.  **There is no bug in §4.**

## What had to be built, and what Mathlib is missing

Contrary to expectation, **no spherical-cap API was needed**.  The paper's `p` is a fraction
of the *whole* sphere of directions, not of a cap, so the entire counting argument is the
polar-coordinate identity `Arlib.MarkovChains.lintegral_polar_at` plus the elementary radial
integral `Arlib.lintegral_pow_Ioc`.  That is `toSphere_mul_le_volume_of_cone`, and it is the
only geometry in this file.

The one piece of API the argument needs beyond that is the invariance of `Measure.toSphere`
under `θ ↦ −θ`.  The paper uses it implicitly, by reading `p` as a property of the sphere
`∂(x + (s/2)B)` (a symmetric object) and then union-bounding over the two endpoints of the
chord.  The cone bound only ever sweeps the outgoing half-ray, so it bounds
`{θ : x + (s/2)θ ∉ K}` and not `{θ : x − (s/2)θ ∉ K}`.

Mathlib v4.32 does not have that invariance, but **this repository now does**:
`Arlib.MarkovChains.toSphere_map_neg` (and its set form `toSphere_preimage_neg`) of
`Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/SphereCoord.lean` proves
`(volume.toSphere).map (Neg.neg) = volume.toSphere`, as the antipodal case of the rotation
invariance `toSphere_map_sphereMap`.  Earlier versions of this file recorded the invariance
as "the single missing API this development would have liked" and worked around it by
reflecting the *body* (`K* = {y : x + x − y ∈ K}`), a ~40-line detour; that detour is gone.
`toSphere_badDir_neg_le` is now three lines: rewrite the incoming bad set as the antipodal
preimage of the outgoing one (`setOf_sub_smul_notMem_eq_preimage_neg`), apply the
invariance, and quote `toSphere_badDir_le`.

## Constants

The paper's own bookkeeping at the last step is `P ≤ 1/16 + (15/16)·(1/16) = 31/256 < 1/8`.
We prove the non-strict `P ≤ 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/8`, which is all that the quantile definition of
`F` consumes (`le_medianStep` compares at radii strictly below `F`) and which avoids `ℝ≥0∞`
truncated subtraction.  The headline constant `32` is the paper's, unchanged.

The engine of Lemma 3.2: a set of directions `D` on the unit sphere, together with a radial
window `(a, b]`, sweeps out a cone of volume `|D| · (bⁿ − aⁿ)/n`, where `|D|` is the
*unnormalised* surface measure `Measure.toSphere`.  This is `lintegral_polar_at` of
`Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRun.lean` and nothing else — no spherical caps are
needed, because the paper's `p` is a fraction of the whole sphere, not of a cap. -/

/-- **The fraction of bad directions is at most `1/32`.**

`p` is the (normalised) surface measure of the set of directions `θ` for which the point
`x + (t/2)θ` — a point of the sphere of radius `t/2` about `x` — falls outside `K`.

This is the paper's `p ≤ 1 − α + 2⁻ⁿ ≤ 1/32`, with the intermediate bound **repaired**: see
the module docstring.  The cone swept out by the bad directions between radii `t/2` and `t`
has volume `p·(vol(tB) − vol((t/2)B))`, and it is disjoint from `K`; comparing with
`vol((x+tB) \ K) ≤ (1−α)vol(tB)` gives `p ≤ (1−α)/(1 − 2⁻ⁿ) ≤ 2(1−α) ≤ 1/32`.  The paper
instead weakens the cone volume to `p·vol(tB) − vol((t/2)B)`, which yields the *false for

/-- **The same bound for the antipodal direction.**

The cone argument only ever sweeps the *outgoing* half-ray `{x + rθ : r > 0}`, so it bounds
the measure of `{θ : x + (t/2)θ ∉ K}` and not that of `{θ : x − (t/2)θ ∉ K}`.  The paper
gets the second bound for free by reading `p` as "the fraction of the sphere `∂(x+(s/2)B)`
outside `K`", which is a symmetric notion; formally that needs the invariance of
`Measure.toSphere` under `θ ↦ −θ`.

That invariance is `Arlib.MarkovChains.toSphere_map_neg` of
`Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/SphereCoord.lean` (set form: `toSphere_preimage_neg`), so the
proof is now the paper's own: the incoming bad directions are the antipodes of the outgoing
ones (`setOf_sub_smul_notMem_eq_preimage_neg`), and the antipodal map preserves the measure.
Earlier versions of this file avoided the invariance by reflecting the *body*

/-- **The paper's `P(|y − x| ≤ s/32) ≤ 1/8`,** for the hit-and-run *proposal* from `x`.

The three ingredients are: at most a `1/32` fraction of directions is bad in each of the two
senses (`toSphere_badDir_le`, `toSphere_badDir_neg_le`), so at most `1/16` of directions
fails the two-sided test; along a direction that passes, the chord of `K` through `x` has
length at least `t`, while the target window `[-t/32, t/32]` has length `t/16`, so the
conditional probability is at most `1/16`.

The paper's own bookkeeping is sharper (`≤ 1/16 + (15/16)(1/16) = 31/256 < 1/8`); the
non-strict `≤ 1/8` proved here is all that `medianStep` consumes, and avoids `ℝ≥0∞`
subtraction. -/

The paper writes `F(x)` as the solution of an equation, which presupposes that the law of
`|x − y|` hits the value `1/8` exactly.  We take instead the lower `1/8`-quantile
`inf {c : P(|x − y| ≤ c) > 1/8}`, which always exists and agrees with the paper's `F`
whenever the paper's equation has a solution.  The two defining inequalities are proved:
`hitAndRun_closedBall_le_of_lt_medianStep` (below `F` the mass is at most `1/8`) and
`le_hitAndRun_closedBall_of_medianStep_lt` (above `F` it is at least `1/8`).  Nothing about
this definition asserts anything unproved. -/

/-! ### Lemma 3.2 -/

/-- **Lemma 3.2 of Lovász–Vempala.**  For `α ≥ 63/64` and any `x` in a convex body `K`,
the median hit-and-run step length satisfies `F(x) ≥ s_α(x)/32`.

Stated as `s_α(x) ≤ 32·F(x)` — which is also the direction §4 of the paper uses it in.

`hmove` is the hypothesis that the walk actually moves from `x`: the hit-and-run *proposal*
carries full mass, i.e. every chord of `K` through `x` has positive finite length.  Without
it the statement is false — the lazy atom of `Arlib.MarkovChains.hitAndRun` sits at `x`
itself, so a walk that stays put with probability more than `1/8` has `F(x) = 0`.  This is
the same hypothesis `Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRun.lean` attaches to every
statement about a walk that moves; `hitAndRunProposal_univ_eq_one_of_mem_interior` below
discharges it for a bounded `K` and an interior `x`.

Note that **no lower bound on `n` appears**, even though the paper's displayed chain
`p ≤ 1 − α + 2⁻ⁿ ≤ 1/32` needs `n ≥ 6`; see the module docstring. -/
