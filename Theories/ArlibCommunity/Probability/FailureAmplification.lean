# Repetition and the logarithmic sample bound

The bookkeeping shared by every "repeat until you succeed" argument, isolated so
that no downstream file has to redo it.

If a single attempt fails with probability at most `c < 1`, then `m` independent
attempts all fail with probability at most `c ^ m`, and driving that below a
confidence parameter `δ` costs

  `m ≥ log δ / log c`

repetitions.  `pow_le_of_log_div_le` is that implication, and
`le_of_pow_le` is its converse, which is what a *lower* bound on the number of
samples needs: an algorithm that succeeds with probability `1 - δ` on an
instance where failure has probability at least `c ^ (N-1)` must have taken
`N ≥ 1 + log δ / log c` samples.

Both directions come down to the same two facts: `Real.log` is monotone, and
`log c < 0` for `c ∈ (0,1)`, so dividing by it reverses inequalities.  Getting
that reversal the right way round is the only content, and it is exactly the
step that is easy to get wrong on paper.

Everything is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-- For any horizon `N` there is a failure probability `c` so close to `1` that

a size-only sample budget impossible: the instance parameter can always be
chosen to defeat it. -/
