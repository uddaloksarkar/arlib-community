# Pinnings and conditional Gibbs measures

A *pinning* fixes the spins on a subset `Λ ⊆ V` and leaves the rest free.  The
Gibbs measure conditioned on a pinning is the object the whole spectral
independence programme is stated over: influence, spectral independence and the
local walks are all defined *for every pinning simultaneously*, and the
local-to-global induction moves between pinnings of successive sizes.

The observation that organises this module is that **conditioning does not leave
the category**: the conditional measure is again a Gibbs measure, for the weight
that has been zeroed off the pinned event.  So there is no new theory to build —
`pinWeight` produces a weight, and every result about `gibbs`, `Zloc`,
`siteChain` and `glauber` applies to it verbatim.

* `AgreesOn Λ η σ` — `σ` matches the pinning `η` on `Λ`.
* `pinWeight w Λ η` — the weight `w` restricted to the pinned event, and
  `pinWeight_union`, which says pinning twice is pinning on the union.  Pinnings
  compose; this is what makes the induction on `|Λ|` work.
* `Pr_agreesOn` — the pinned event has Gibbs probability `Z(w|Λ,η) / Z(w)`, and
  `gibbsPin_eq_cond` — the conditional measure really is conditioning.
* **`siteUpdate_eq_gibbsPin`** — the headline: the single-site heat-bath update at
  `v` *is* the Gibbs measure conditioned on the pinning of `V \ {v}` by the
  current configuration.  This is the definition of the Glauber dynamics as
  usually stated in words ("resample the spin at `v` from its conditional
  distribution"), recovered here as a theorem about `Chains.Glauber.siteUpdate`,
  and it is the bridge from the chain to the pinning-indexed quantities.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## The pinned weight

Conditioning a Gibbs measure on a pinning is the same as zeroing its weight off
the pinned event.  This keeps us inside `Chains.SpinSystem`, so nothing about
conditional measures has to be redeveloped. -/

section PinWeight

agreeing with `η` on `Λ`, and `0` elsewhere.  The Gibbs measure of `pinWeight`

/-! ## The Glauber dynamics as resampling from a conditional measure

The single-site update at `v` is exactly the Gibbs measure conditioned on
pinning every *other* site to its current value.  Stating the chain this way is
what connects it to the pinning-indexed machinery of the local walks. -/

`siteUpdate w v σ` is the Gibbs measure of `w` conditioned on pinning every site
other than `v` to its value in `σ`.  This is the textbook description of the
Glauber dynamics — "redraw the spin at `v` from its conditional distribution
given the rest" — proved here rather than taken as the definition. -/
