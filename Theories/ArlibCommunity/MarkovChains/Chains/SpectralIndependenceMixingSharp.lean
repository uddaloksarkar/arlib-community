# Spectral independence implies a spectral gap for Glauber — the sharp constant

`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing` assembles the monograph's central theorem and
pays for one design choice upstream: `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` multiplies its
induction through by `2γ_j - 1`, so it needs `γ_j ≥ 1/2`, which at the binding
level (two free sites, `γ = 2 - η`) reads **`η ≤ 3/2`** — and the constant is
already `0` there.  `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp` now supplies
the same theorem with the level factor `γ_j/(2 - γ_j)` of `[CLV21, Fact A.8]`,
which needs only `0 ≤ γ_j ≤ 2`.  This module repoints the assembly at it.

**Which side conditions actually bind.**  With `γ_j = siGamma n η j = ((n-j) - η)/((n-j) - 1)`
and `d = n - j - 1 ≥ 1` free sites minus one, so that `γ_j = (d + 1 - η)/d`:

| side condition | equivalent constraint | binding level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0 ≤ 2γ_j - 1` (old) | `η ≤ 3/2` | `d = 1` |
| `0 ≤ γ_j` (new) | `η ≤ 2` | `d = 1` |
| `γ_j ≤ 2` (both) | `0 ≤ η` | `d = 1` |

So the sharp route's *provability* hypothesis is `η ≤ 2` alone: `0 ≤ η` is not
assumed but **derived**, exactly as in the unsharpened module, by
`nonneg_of_spectralIndependence` at the empty pinning.  This is the first place
the natural guess `0 < η < 2` is wrong — the theorem is true, and stated below,
under `η ≤ 2`.

**Where `0 < η < 2` is the right range.**  It is the range on which the constant
is *positive*, i.e. on which the theorem has content, and there it is two-sided
for a genuine reason.  `sharpStep γ_j = (d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)`
(`sharpStep_siGamma`), so:

* at `η = 2` the numerator vanishes at `d = 1` and the constant is `0`;
* at `η = 0` the *denominator* vanishes at `d = 1` — the level gap is exactly
  `γ = 2` — and Lean's `x/0 = 0` makes the constant `0` again.

The second degeneracy has no analogue in the old route, where `2γ - 1 = 3` at
`γ = 2`.  It is `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.sharpStep_two_lt_two_mul_sub_one`
instantiated, and it is why the sharp theorem is **not** a strict improvement:
`0 ≤ η` is free, and at `η = 0` the old theorem has a positive constant while this
one does not.  The monograph's classical `|η₀| < 1` is `0 < η < 2` for the same
reason.

That loss is confined to one measure.  By
`Techniques.SpectralIndependence.one_sub_marg_le_of_spectralIndependence`, `η = 0`
forces every charged marginal to be `1`, so it can only happen at a point mass
(`pos_of_spectralIndependence_of_marg_lt_one`).  The `3/2 < η < 2` gain is not
confined in any such way.

**What is gained, precisely.**  On the overlap `0 < η ≤ 3/2` both theorems apply
and this one is at least as strong, denominators included
(`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div_siGamma`, an instantiation of the abstract
comparison, followed by `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_le_sharp`,
which *derives* the old theorem's conclusion from this one's).  On
`3/2 < η < 2` the old route has no statement at all — its side condition is
violated at the level `j = n - 2`, with the strictly negative value `3 - 2η`
(`two_mul_siGamma_sub_one_neg`) — while this one gives a strictly positive
constant (`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_sharp_pos`).

**The calibration survives.**  `sharpStep 1 = 1 = 2·1 - 1`, so at `η = 1` every
`Γ_i` is `1`, the sum is `n`, and the constant is exactly `1/n` — the same real
expression the unsharpened module reaches and the same one
`Chains.ProductMeasure.approxTensorization_prodWeight` reaches by approximate
tensorization.  The product-measure corollary is therefore restated through the
sharp route, and `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight_audit_sharp` exhibits the
three proofs of the identical proposition side by side.

**Main declarations.**

* `siGamma_nonneg`, `siGamma_lt_two` — the two side conditions of the sharp
  Improved Random Walk Theorem, checked against `siGamma`: `0 ≤ γ_j` is `η ≤ 2`,
  and `γ_j < 2` (the strict form the comparison needs) is `0 < η`.
* **`sharpStep_siGamma`** — the sharp level factor in closed form,
  `(d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)`, and `sharpStep_siGamma_pos`.
* `sharpStep_one`, `sharpFactor_const_one`, `sharpFactor_siGamma_pos`,
  `sharpFactor_siGamma_div_pos` — the calibration and the positivity of the
  constant.
* **`two_mul_siGamma_sub_one_neg`** — on `3/2 < η` the old side condition fails,
  strictly, at the level `j = n - 2`.  This is the precise sense in which the old
  theorem says nothing there.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_sharp`** — **the headline**:
  spectral independence at every pinning, `η ≤ 2`, gives the Glauber dynamics the
  Poincaré constant `Γ_m/∑_{i≤m} Γ_i` with `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i} γ_j/(2 - γ_j)`.
* `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_sharp_pos` — the same with
  the constant certified positive, on `0 < η < 2`.
* **`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div_siGamma`** and
  **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_le_sharp`** — the
  comparison, proved rather than asserted, on `0 < η ≤ 3/2`.
* `pos_of_spectralIndependence_of_marg_lt_one` — the lower endpoint of that
  overlap is free for every measure that is not a point mass.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_sharp_one`**,
  `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_pairwiseIndep_sharp`,
  `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight_via_spectralIndependence_sharp`,
  `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight_audit_sharp` — the calibration point and
  the product-measure audit, through the sharp route.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular no
eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## The side conditions of the sharp theorem, at `siGamma`

`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp` asks for `0 ≤ γ_j` and `γ_j ≤ 2` at *every*
`j : ℕ`, including the levels above the dimension of the complex, where `siGamma`
returns the junk value `1`.  Both conditions hold there with room, so what follows
is entirely about the levels `j + 1 < n`, where `siGamma n η j = (N - η)/(N - 1)`
with `N = n - j ≥ 2` free sites.

`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.siGamma_le_two` already proves the second
condition from `0 ≤ η` and is reused verbatim; the two new facts are that `0 ≤ γ_j`
is `η ≤ 2` rather than `η ≤ 3/2`, and that the *strict* `γ_j < 2` needed by the
comparison is `0 < η`. -/

section Gamma

/-- **The first side condition of the sharp theorem, `0 ≤ γ_j`, is `η ≤ 2`.**

The numerator `(n - j) - η` is smallest at the last level, where `n - j = 2` and it
is `2 - η`.  So `η ≤ 2` is sharp for this family, and it replaces the `η ≤ 3/2` of
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.two_mul_siGamma_sub_one_nonneg` — which is the
same computation for `2γ_j - 1 = ((n-j) + 1 - 2η)/((n-j) - 1)`, whose numerator at
`n - j = 2` is `3 - 2η`. -/

`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.siGamma_le_two` gets the non-strict `γ_j ≤ 2`
from `0 ≤ η`, and that is all the sharp theorem needs.  The *strict* inequality is
what `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div`
requires, and it costs the extra `0 < η`: at `η = 0` the last level has
`γ = 2` exactly, where the sharp factor degenerates to `0`. -/

minus one.  Compare `two_mul_siGamma_sub_one`, which gives `(d + 2 - 2η)/d`.

This is `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.sharpStep_free_sites` with `d` taken to
be the real number `(n - j) - 1`; no hypothesis on the denominator is needed,
because at `(n - j) - 2 + η = 0` both sides are `0` by Lean's division
convention. -/

The numerator `(n - j) - η` is at least `2 - η > 0` and the denominator
`(n - j) - 2 + η` is at least `η > 0`.

Both endpoints are needed and neither is an artefact: at `η = 2` the numerator
vanishes at the last level, at `η = 0` the denominator does.  Contrast the old
factor `2γ_j - 1`, which is positive for every `η < 3/2` including `η ≤ 0`. -/

The denominator `∑_{i≤m} Γ_i` is at least `1` by `one_le_sum_sharpFactor`, so this

`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` is not merely unavailable: it is refuted, its

to make.  That is the precise content of "the old theorem says nothing" on

/-! ## The headline, sharpened

The proof is `Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing`'s, with
`Techniques.LocalWalkBridge.downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast_of_localWalk_gap`
replaced by
`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.downUp_top_spectralGapAtLeast_sharp_of_localWalk_gap`
and the side condition `0 ≤ 2γ_j - 1` replaced by `0 ≤ γ_j`.  The hypothesis
shapes are otherwise identical, so every join lemma of that module —
`exists_pinGraph_of_mu_pos`, `gibbsPin_gibbsWeight`,
`spectralGapAtLeast_localWalk_of_spectralIndependence` — is reused unchanged. -/

/-- **Spectral independence at every pinning implies a spectral gap for the
Glauber dynamics — with the sharp constant.**

Let `w` be a nonnegative weight on configurations with `Z w > 0`, on `n = m + 1`
sites, and suppose every conditional Gibbs measure `μ_ζ` is `η`-spectrally
independent, with `η ≤ 2`.  Then the Glauber dynamics of `w` satisfies the
Poincaré inequality with constant

  **`Γ_m / ∑_{i ≤ m} Γ_i`,  `Γ_i = ∏_{j < i} siGamma (m+1) η j / (2 - siGamma (m+1) η j)`,**

and `sharpStep (siGamma (m+1) η j) = ((m + 1 - j) - η)/((m + 1 - j) - 2 + η)` by
`sharpStep_siGamma`.  Reindexed by the number `d = m - j` of free sites minus one,
the numerator is `Γ_m = ∏_{d=1}^{m} (d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)`.

*Three remarks on the hypotheses, in the shape of the unsharpened theorem's.*

`0 ≤ η` is **not** assumed: it is derived, by `nonneg_of_spectralIndependence`
applied to the empty pinning, and it is exactly what the side condition `γ_j ≤ 2`
needs.

`η ≤ 2` replaces the `η ≤ 3/2` of
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence`
and is sharp for this route: at `η > 2` the last level has a negative gap.  At
`η = 2`, and also at `η = 0`, the constant is `0` and the statement is vacuous;
`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_sharp_pos` is the version with
the constant certified positive.

Spectral independence is required at **every** pinning, including the empty
one. -/

`(d + 1 - η)/(d - 1 + η)` at the binding level `d = 1`: the numerator vanishes at
`η = 2`, the denominator at `η = 0`.

On `3/2 < η < 2` this is a bound that

/-! ## The comparison, proved rather than asserted

`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div` compares
the two constants for an abstract family `γ` under `1/2 ≤ γ_j < 2`.  Instantiated
at `siGamma` those two hypotheses become `η ≤ 3/2` and `0 < η`, so the overlap on
which the sharp theorem provably dominates the old one is `0 < η ≤ 3/2`.

The lower endpoint is not slack.  At `η = 0` the old theorem still applies —
`0 ≤ η` is all `siGamma_le_two` needs — and its constant is positive, while the
sharp constant is `0`.  So the sharpening is a strict improvement only on
`0 < η`, and it is a genuine loss at `η = 0`, in exactly the way
`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp` warns for `γ = 2`. -/

independence.**  For `0 < η ≤ 3/2`,

  **`Γ^{old}_m / ∑_{i≤m} Γ^{old}_i  ≤  Γ^{new}_m / ∑_{i≤m} Γ^{new}_i`.**

This is `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalkSharp.improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div`
with its two abstract hypotheses discharged: `0 ≤ 2γ_j - 1` by
`two_mul_siGamma_sub_one_nonneg` (that is `η ≤ 3/2`) and the strict `γ_j < 2` by
`siGamma_lt_two` (that is `0 < η`).

It is not a formality — the sharp factors are larger, but they occur in the
denominator too, so the comparison only survives after cross-multiplying. -/

/-- **`0 < η` is free unless the measure is deterministic at every site.**

`Techniques.SpectralIndependence.one_sub_marg_le_of_spectralIndependence` says
`1 - μ(σ_v = s) ≤ η` at every charged pair, so a single site whose marginal is
strictly between `0` and `1` already forces `η > 0`.

This is what rescues the comparison.  The `0 < η` hypothesis of
`improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div_siGamma` and
`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_le_sharp` looks like a new
restriction, and formally it is one — but `η = 0` forces every charged marginal to
be `1`, i.e. forces the measure to be a point mass.  On every measure that is not
a point mass, `0 < η` holds automatically and the sharp constant is at least the

to a single degenerate measure, whereas the `3/2 < η < 2` gain is not. -/

/-- **The sharp theorem implies the old one, on the overlap `0 < η ≤ 3/2`.**

The conclusion here is *literally the statement* of
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence`,
derived from the sharp theorem by `improvedFactor_div_le_sharpFactor_div_siGamma`
and `SpectralGapAtLeast.mono`.  So on `0 < η ≤ 3/2` nothing is lost by working
with the sharp constant, and by `sharpStep_sub_two_mul_sub_one` the gain is
`2(γ_j - 1)²/(2 - γ_j)` at each level — zero only at `η = 1`, and divergent as the
level gap approaches `2`.

The hypothesis `0 < η` is the only thing this direction adds, it is exactly
the `γ_j < 2` that the abstract comparison cannot drop, and by
`pos_of_spectralIndependence_of_marg_lt_one` it is automatic for every measure
that is not a point mass. -/

/-! ## The calibration, and the product-measure audit

`sharpStep 1 = 1 = 2·1 - 1`, so the two routes agree exactly at `η = 1`: every
level gap is `1`, every `Γ_i` is `1`, the sum is `n`, and the constant is `1/n` on
the nose.  This is the check that mattered — a discrepancy here would have meant
one of the two Improved Random Walk Theorems was wrong — and it passes.

`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence` discharges the hypothesis at `η = 1` for a
real weight, so the corollary below is unconditional, and
`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight_audit_sharp` now exhibits *three* proofs of
the same proposition: approximate tensorization, the old Improved Random Walk
Theorem, and the sharp one. -/

variable {S : Type*} [Fintype S] [DecidableEq S]

/-- **The calibration point survives the sharpening: at `η = 1` the sharp constant
is exactly `1/n`.**

`η = 1` is the monograph's `0`-spectral independence.  Every level gap is `1`,
`sharpStep 1 = 1`, so every `Γ_i` is `1`, the sum is `n`, and the bound is the
optimal relaxation time `1/n` — the identical real expression that
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing.spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_spectralIndependence_one`
and `Chains.ProductMeasure.approxTensorization_prodWeight` produce.

Note `1` sits strictly inside `0 < η < 2` and strictly inside `0 < η ≤ 3/2`, so
this point is in the overlap and both routes are non-vacuous there. -/

`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence.pairwiseIndep_gibbsPin_prodWeight` discharges
the hypothesis, so this is unconditional.  The route differs from
`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence.spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_prodWeight_via_spectralIndependence`
only in the level factor used inside the induction — `γ/(2 - γ)` here, `2γ - 1`
there — and the two constants coincide because `sharpStep 1 = 1`. -/

/-- **The audit, now threefold.**

The same proposition — `γ(P_Glauber) ≥ 1/(Fintype.card V)` for the Gibbs measure of
a product weight — proved three ways: by approximate tensorization of variance
(`Chains.ProductMeasure`), by spectral independence through the monograph's
`2γ - 1` Improved Random Walk Theorem
(`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence`), and by spectral independence through the
sharp `γ/(2 - γ)` one (this file).

That all three terms typecheck against the *same* statement is the content: the
sharpening changes the constant nowhere at `η = 1`, which is what
`sharpStep_one` predicts and what a bug in either Improved Random Walk Theorem
would have broken. -/
