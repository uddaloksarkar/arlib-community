# The independent sampler

The chain that ignores its current state and redraws from `μ`:
`P(x, y) = μ(y)`.  It is the chain you would use if you could sample from `μ`
directly — which is exactly what MCMC exists to avoid — so it is useless as an
algorithm and maximally useful as a calibration point.

Where `Chains.TwoState` pins down the *generic* behaviour of the general theory,
this module pins down its *extreme*: the independent sampler saturates every
inequality in the library at the best possible value.  Its Dirichlet form **is**
the variance, so its Poincaré constant is exactly `1` — the largest a spectral
gap can be — and it reaches stationarity in a single step.  Any general theorem
whose conclusion is not tight here has slack that should be looked at.

* `independentSampler` — the chain, and `act_independentSampler`, which says it
  collapses every function to the constant `Ex μ f`.
* `independentSampler_reversible`, `independentSampler_stationary`.
* `dirichlet_independentSampler` — **`ℰ_P(f) = Var_μ(f)`**, an identity.
* `independentSampler_spectralGapAtLeast` — spectral gap `1`, and
  `independentSampler_nonnegDefinite`, so the chain sits inside the hypotheses of
  `Techniques.SpectralGap` with `c = 0`.
* `Var_act_independentSampler` — the variance is annihilated in one step, and
  `independentSampler_mixesWithin_one` — total variation distance `0` after one
  step, which is the strongest possible form of the mixing statement.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

@[simp] theorem row_independentSampler (μ : FinDist Ω) (x : Ω) :
    (independentSampler μ).row x = μ := FinDist.ext fun _ => rfl

/-! ## Detailed balance -/

/-- **Detailed balance** for the independent sampler: `μ(x) μ(y) = μ(y) μ(x)`. -/

    Reversible μ (independentSampler μ) := fun x y => by

/-- **The Dirichlet form of the independent sampler is exactly the variance.**

`ℰ_P(f) = ⟪f,f⟫_μ - (μ f)² = Var_μ(f)`.  Local variation and global variation
coincide, which is the precise sense in which this chain has no geometry at all. -/

Poincaré constant can take, attained with equality for every `f`. -/

/-! ## One-step convergence

With gap `1`, `Techniques.SpectralGap` predicts contraction by `(1 - 1)² = 0`.
The chain does exactly that: it is stationary after a single step, in variance
and in total variation alike. -/

    Var μ ((independentSampler μ).act f) = 0 := by

/-- **One step suffices**: the distribution after one step is exactly `μ`, so the
total variation distance to stationarity is `0`. -/
