# Optimal relaxation time implies spectral independence

This module proves `lem:opt-relax-SI` of the source monograph — Zongchen Chen,
Daniel Štefankovič, Eric Vigoda, *Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global
Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains*, arXiv:2307.13826 (2023), cited
below as [CSV23] — which attributes the lemma to Anari–Jain–Koehler–Pham–Vuong
(which of their papers is meant is not recorded anywhere in this library):
**a Glauber dynamics that mixes optimally is spectrally independent.**  It is the converse of the development's
central implication, `Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing`, and it closes the loop:
spectral independence is not merely *sufficient* for an `O(n)` relaxation time,
it is *necessary*.

`Techniques.SpectralIndependenceConverse` proves the analogous converse for the
**local walk** `Q_τ`, by reading the exact identity `dirichlet_pinLocalWalk`
backwards, and records that this does not give `lem:opt-relax-SI`, because the
chain there is the Glauber dynamics and the passage from a Glauber gap to a
local-walk gap would be a converse Random Walk Theorem.  That is right, and the
route taken here avoids the local walk entirely.  It is shorter than the forward
direction and uses only two facts already in the library:

* `Techniques.SpectralIndependence.quadForm_Cov` — the covariance form evaluated
  at `a` **is** the variance of the linear statistic `spinComb a`,
  `σ ↦ ∑_v a (v, σ v)`; and
* `Chains.GlauberTensorization.dirichlet_glauber` — the Dirichlet form of the
  Glauber dynamics **is** `(1/n) ∑_v μ[Var_v(f)]`.

So one tests the Glauber Poincaré inequality at the *linear statistics* only.
The left-hand side is then the covariance form on the nose, and the right-hand
side needs the one new inequality of this module:

  `μ[Var_v(spinComb a)] ≤ ∑_s marg μ (v,s) · a (v,s)²`.

**This step is exact where it looks lossy.**  Resampling the spin at `v` changes
exactly one summand of `∑_u a (u, σ u)`, and the other `n − 1` summands *cancel*
rather than merely being bounded: `siteVar` is a Dirichlet form, and a Dirichlet
form only ever sees the increments `f σ − f τ` along transitions, which for the
single-site update at `v` are `a (v, σ v) − a (v, τ v)`.  That is
`siteVar_congr_of_agreeOff`, and it is an equality.  The only inequality is the
last one, "a conditional variance is at most a conditional second moment", which
here is `⟪g, P_v g⟫ ≥ 0` — positive semidefiniteness of the heat-bath update,
itself free (`Glauber.siteChain_nonnegDefinite`).  So the constant is not merely
of the right order; it is the monograph's, exactly:

  **relaxation time `≤ C·n`  ⟹  `λ_max(Ψ_μ) ≤ C`**,

which in this development's normalisation (our `η` is the monograph's `1 + η`;
see `Techniques.SpectralIndependence`) is `SpectralIndependence μ C`, i.e. the
monograph's `(C−1)`-spectral independence.

**What "exactly" does and does not mean.**  The *constant of the statement* is
carried across with no degradation: no factor of two, no `C + 1`, no `n`.  The
*deduction* is not lossless pointwise, and it should not be expected to be — a
measure can be more spectrally independent than its relaxation time reveals.  The
entire slack is the discarded term `⟪P_v g, P_v g⟫` of `siteVar_le_ip_self`, the
mean square of the conditional mean of `s ↦ a (v,s)`, and it vanishes exactly
when that conditional mean does.  For the two-site model
`μ(00) = μ(11) = (1+δ)/4`, `μ(01) = μ(10) = (1−δ)/4` the true gap is `(1−δ)/2`
and the true constant is `1 + δ`, while this theorem returns `1/(1−δ)`; the two
agree to first order and coincide at `δ = 0`, the product case, where the
theorem is tight.

## The pinned statement, and the factor `n − |S|`

The monograph quantifies over pinnings, and asks that the Glauber dynamics *for
`μ_τ`* have relaxation time `≤ C·(n − |S|)`.  `Chains.PinnedGlauber` warns
(`siteChainPin_of_mem`, and `docs/dev/MarkovChains-ROADMAP.md` §3.6) that `glauber (pinWeight w Λ τ)`
is **not** that chain: it averages over all `|V|` sites and the `|Λ|` pinned ones
are no-ops, so it is the conditional Glauber dynamics *with holding probability*
`|Λ|/|V|`.  Getting this right is the whole content of the pinned statement, so
the chain the monograph means is built here, as `freeGlauber`: the mixture of
single-site updates with the uniform weights on the *free* sites.  Then

  `ℰ_{P_GD}(f) ≥ ((n−|Λ|)/n) · ℰ_{freeGlauber}(f)`,

with no hypothesis beyond `siteVar ≥ 0` — the pinned sites need not be shown to
be no-ops, only to contribute nonnegatively — and the two factors of `n − |Λ|`
cancel exactly:

  `((n−|Λ|)/n) · 1/(C·(n−|Λ|)) = 1/(C·n)`.

That is why the monograph's `n − |S|` is the right normalisation and no other
would do.

## Main declarations

* `agreeOff_of_siteUpdate_ne_zero`, **`siteVar_congr_of_agreeOff`** — a Dirichlet
  form sees only increments along transitions, so two functions with equal
  single-site increments have equal mean conditional variance.  This is the
  cancellation of the other `n − 1` sites, as an identity.
* `siteVar_le_ip_self`, `spinComb_sub_of_agreeOff`, **`siteVar_spinComb_le`** and
  `sum_siteVar_spinComb_le` — **the core inequality**, for an arbitrary
  nonnegative weight.
* **`spectralIndependence_of_approxTensorization`** — `C`-approximate
  tensorization of variance implies `C`-spectral independence, with *the same
  constant*.  This is the honest core: the Glauber dynamics enters only through
  `GlauberTensorization`'s equivalence.
* **`spectralIndependence_of_spectralGapAtLeast_glauber`** and
  **`spectralIndependence_of_relaxationTime_glauber`** — the unpinned
  `lem:opt-relax-SI`: gap `γ` gives `SpectralIndependence μ (1/(γn))`, so
  relaxation time `≤ Cn` gives `λ_max(Ψ_μ) ≤ C`.
* `freeSiteWeight`, **`freeGlauber`**, `dirichlet_freeGlauber`,
  `dirichlet_freeGlauber_empty`, **`dirichlet_freeGlauber_le`**,
  `spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_freeGlauber` — the conditional Glauber dynamics
  on the free sites, and the factor `(n−|Λ|)/n` relating it to the all-sites
  chain.
* **`spectralIndependence_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`**,
  `spectralIndependence_gibbsPin_of_card_le` and
  **`spectralIndependence_pinned_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`** —
  `lem:opt-relax-SI` at one pinning and then at every pinning.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_pinLocalWalk_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`** — a
  *converse Random Walk Theorem*, which `Techniques.SpectralIndependenceConverse`
  reports as unavailable: composing this module with
  `Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence` takes a Glauber gap at a pinning to a
  local-walk gap at that pinning.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_relaxationTime_freeGlauber`** and
  **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_of_optimalRelaxationTime`** — the round trip,
  Glauber gap ⟹ spectral independence ⟹ Glauber gap, and the fact that it is
  **lossless exactly at `C = 1`**; the first docstring says what it costs
  otherwise.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular no
eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## A Dirichlet form sees only single-site increments

The mean conditional variance `siteVar` is a Dirichlet form, and
`dirichlet_self_eq_pair` writes it as `½ ∑_{σ,τ} μ(σ) P_v(σ,τ) (f σ − f τ)²`.
The single-site update charges no pair that disagrees away from `v`, so only the
increments of `f` across a change of the spin at `v` matter.  For a linear
statistic those increments involve one summand, and the remaining `n − 1`
summands cancel identically. -/

/-- **Equal single-site increments give equal mean conditional variance.**

If `f σ − f τ = g σ − g τ` whenever `σ` and `τ` agree away from `v`, then
`μ[Var_v(f)] = μ[Var_v(g)]`.  This is an *identity*, not an estimate, and it is
the step that makes the core inequality below tight: a Dirichlet form is a sum
over transitions of squared increments, and the single-site update at `v` makes
no transition that changes any other site
(`agreeOff_of_siteUpdate_ne_zero`). -/

/-! ## The core inequality

Testing the Glauber Poincaré inequality at a linear statistic `spinComb a` needs
an upper bound on `μ[Var_v(spinComb a)]` in terms of the marginals, and the
bound is the second moment of the single site `v` alone. -/

/-- **A single-site move changes one summand of a linear statistic.**

If `σ` and `τ` agree away from `v` then
`spinComb a σ − spinComb a τ = a (v, σ v) − a (v, τ v)`: the other `n − 1`
summands of `∑_u a (u, σ u)` cancel termwise.  This is the cancellation that has
to be an equality rather than a bound for the core inequality below to carry the
monograph's constant. -/

`μ[Var_v(spinComb a)] ≤ ∑_s μ(σ v = s) · a (v,s)²`.

Two steps, one exact and one an inequality.  `siteVar_congr_of_agreeOff` with
`spinComb_sub_of_agreeOff` replaces `spinComb a` by the single-site function
`σ ↦ a (v, σ v)` — *exactly*, because the mean conditional variance at `v` only
sees increments across a change at `v`.  Then `siteVar_le_ip_self` drops the
conditional mean, and `sum_mu_coord` reads the resulting second moment off the
marginals at `v`.

no pinning, no spectral independence and no Glauber dynamics appears. -/

/-! ## From a Poincaré inequality to spectral independence

`quadForm_Cov` says the covariance form at `a` is `Var_μ(spinComb a)`, so any
upper bound on the variance of a *linear statistic* by the local quantities is a
spectral independence statement.  Approximate tensorization is such a bound, and
`GlauberTensorization` already knows it is the same thing as a Glauber gap. -/

section FromTensorization

/-- **Approximate tensorization implies spectral independence, with the same
constant.**

`Var_μ(f) ≤ C ∑_v μ[Var_v(f)]` for every `f` gives `Cov_μ ⪯ C · diag(marg_μ)`.
Only the linear statistics `f = spinComb a` are used, which is why the constant
survives unchanged: `quadForm_Cov` turns the left-hand side into the covariance
form and `sum_siteVar_spinComb_le` turns the right-hand side into the diagonal
form.

This is the mathematical core of `lem:opt-relax-SI`; the Glauber dynamics enters
only through `approxTensorization_of_spectralGapAtLeast_glauber`. -/

is the monograph's exactly, with no degradation across the implication; the
implication itself is an inequality, and the module docstring measures its slack
against a two-site model.

Two things this does *not* need, which the monograph's statement has: the spin

exactly `0` (`PinnedGlauber.siteChainPin_of_mem`), so the inequality is then an

The arithmetic that makes the statement work is

the free-site gap `1/(C·(n−|Λ|))` becomes an all-sites gap of `1/(C·n)` after the
slowdown of `dirichlet_freeGlauber_le`, and `1/(C·n)` is exactly what the
unpinned theorem consumes.  The factor `n − |Λ|` in the monograph's hypothesis is
therefore not a convenience: it is the unique normalisation for which the pinned

the Glauber gap to spectral independence, and
`Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence` takes spectral independence to a
local-walk gap.  Composing,

/-! ## The round trip

`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing` turns spectral independence at every pinning
back into a Glauber Poincaré inequality.  Composing it with the theorem above
gives a statement of the form "Glauber gap ⟹ Glauber gap", and the honest
question is what the composition costs. -/

section RoundTrip

variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] [Nonempty V]
variable {S : Type*} [Fintype S] [DecidableEq S]

/-- **The round trip: Glauber gap ⟹ spectral independence ⟹ Glauber gap.**

Assume that at *every* pinning `τ` on `Λ` the conditional Glauber dynamics has
relaxation time at most `C·(n − |Λ|)`, with `1 ≤ C ≤ 3/2`.  Then the *unpinned*
Glauber dynamics satisfies the Poincaré inequality with constant

  `Γ_{n−1}/n`,  `Γ_{n−1} = ∏_{d=1}^{n−1} (d + 2 − 2C)/d`.

**What the round trip loses.**  We started from a relaxation time `≤ Cn` (the
`Λ = ∅` case of the hypothesis) and came back with `n/Γ_{n−1}`, so the loss is
the factor `1/Γ_{n−1}`, which is `1` at `C = 1` and grows polynomially in `n` as
`C` increases — not a constant factor.  Two further losses are in the
*hypotheses* rather than the constant: the return leg needs the gap at every
pinning where the outward leg needed it only at one, and it is restricted to
`C ≤ 3/2`.

**None of this loss is in this module.**  The outward leg carries its constant
unchanged, and
`Techniques.SpectralIndependence.one_sub_marg_le_of_spectralIndependence` shows
that constant cannot be pushed below `1`, so it contributes no factor to the
composite at all.  All of the degradation is in the return leg: the `C ≤ 3/2`
restriction and the `Γ` factor are artefacts of
`Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` weakening `1/(1 − γ/2)` to `2γ − 1`, as
`Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing`'s module docstring analyses at length.  So
this composite is a *measurement of the return leg's loss*, and a demonstration
that the two directions of the theory are not yet inverse to each other. -/

/-- **The round trip is lossless exactly at `C = 1`.**

*If at every pinning the conditional Glauber dynamics has relaxation time at most
`n − |Λ|`, then the Glauber dynamics has relaxation time at most `n`.*

At `C = 1` every `Γ_i` of the theorem above equals `1`, the sum is `n`, and the
returned constant is exactly `1/n` — the same constant the hypothesis asserts at
the empty pinning.  So the composite is the identity here, which is the
calibration point for the whole loop: `C = 1` is the monograph's `0`-spectral
independence, the value a product measure attains
(`Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence`), and `1/n` is the true relaxation time of
the Glauber dynamics of a product measure.

For `C > 1` the loop is strictly lossy; see the previous docstring. -/
