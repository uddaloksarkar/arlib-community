# The Glauber dynamics through the level machinery

`Chains.LevelEncoding` proves that the down-up walk at the top level of the
weighted complex induced by a spin system *is* the Glauber dynamics
(`spinDownUp_apply_graph`).  That identification is an equality of matrix
entries between two chains on two different state spaces, so on its own it
transfers nothing: `Techniques.Levels` proves `downUp_nonnegDefinite` about a
chain on `Finset (V × S)`, and the Gibbs sampler lives on `V → S`.

This module closes the gap, using `Techniques.Transport`.  The encoding is
`graph : (V → S) → Finset (V × S)`, which is injective (`graph_injective`), and
the top-level distribution of the induced complex is the Gibbs measure
(`spinTop_graph`) — provided the weight is normalised, which is where the one
piece of genuine bookkeeping lives:

**Normalisation.**  `Techniques.Levels` builds `pi w n k` only from a weight of
total mass `1`, whereas a spin system carries an unnormalised weight `w` with
partition function `Z w`.  So the complex must be built from `gibbsWeight w =
w / Z w`, not from `w`.  This costs nothing, because the Glauber dynamics is
scale-invariant (`glauber_gibbsWeight`): rescaling the weight rescales every
local partition function by the same factor and leaves every transition
probability unchanged.

The pay-off is threefold.

* `glauber_nonnegDefinite_via_levels` — positive semidefiniteness of the Gibbs
  sampler, for the **third** time in this development and by a third route:
  after self-adjoint idempotence (`Chains.Glauber`) and the mixture argument
  (`Chains.BlockDynamics`), now from the adjointness of the up and down
  operators.  Still no eigenvalue anywhere.
* `glauber_reversible_via_levels` — likewise for detailed balance.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_iff`** — the point of the whole exercise: a
  Poincaré inequality for the down-up walk of the induced complex *is* a
  Poincaré inequality for the Gibbs sampler, with the same constant.  Any
  future local-to-global theorem proved in `Techniques.Levels` reaches the Gibbs
  sampler through this equivalence.

Main declarations:

* `gibbsWeight`, `glauber_gibbsWeight` — the normalised weight and the
  scale-invariance of the Glauber dynamics.
* `spinTop`, `spinPin`, `spinUp`, `spinTopDownUp` — the induced complex's top
  level, the level below, the up operator, and the down-up walk.
* `spinTop_graph` — **the top-level distribution is the Gibbs measure**.
* `transport_graph`, `encodes_spinTopDownUp` — the transport data.
* **`spectralGapAtLeast_glauber_iff`**, `glauber_nonnegDefinite_via_levels`,
  `glauber_reversible_via_levels`, `dirichlet_glauber_eq`,
  **`dirichlet_glauber_eq_norm_loss`**.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular
no eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## Normalising the weight

`Techniques.Levels` insists on a top-level weight of total mass `1`; a spin
system supplies an arbitrary nonnegative `w`.  The bridge is `gibbsWeight`, and
the reason the bridge is free is that the Glauber dynamics does not see the
scale of `w` at all. -/

/-! ## Transport along `graph`

The encoding is `graph`, which `Chains.LevelEncoding` already proved injective.
The two chains agree only on rows of positive weight, which is exactly the slack
`Techniques.Transport` allows in `Encodes`. -/

/-- **The down-up walk encodes the Glauber dynamics along `graph`.**

This is `spinDownUp_apply_graph` of `Chains.LevelEncoding`, stated in the form
`Techniques.Transport` consumes: on every row the Gibbs measure charges, the two
chains have the same entries.  Rows of weight zero are excluded — there the two
constructions genuinely differ. -/

/-- **The Poincaré inequality transports.**

A spectral gap for the down-up walk of the induced complex *is* a spectral gap
for the Gibbs sampler, with the same constant and in both directions.  This is
the mechanism by which any future local-to-global theorem proved in
`Techniques.Levels` reaches the Glauber dynamics. -/

/-- **The Dirichlet forms agree.**  A function on the top level of the complex
restricts along `graph` to a function on configurations, and the two Dirichlet
forms of the corresponding chains coincide. -/

/-- **The Dirichlet form of the Gibbs sampler is a loss of `L²` norm under the up
operator.**

`ℰ_{P_GD}(F ∘ graph) = ⟪F, F⟫_{π_top} − ⟪U F, U F⟫_{π_pin}`.  This is the shape
in which the Dirichlet form enters the local-to-global induction of §5.1, now
available for the Glauber dynamics itself; compare `dirichlet_glauber` of
`Chains.GlauberTensorization`, which expresses the same quantity as an average of
conditional variances. -/

/-! ## The Gibbs sampler, seen from the level machinery

These are the conclusions in the form the rest of the development uses them:
statements about `glauber` alone, with the complex, its levels and its walks
appearing only inside the proofs.  The dimension hypothesis `hm` is carried
explicitly because the statements themselves do not mention it. -/

/-- **The Glauber dynamics is positive semidefinite — third proof.**

After self-adjoint idempotence of a single-site update (`Chains.Glauber`) and
the mixture argument (`Chains.BlockDynamics`), this derivation goes through the
adjointness of the up and down operators of the induced weighted complex and the
transport of `⟪f, P f⟫` along `graph`.  No eigenvalue is used in any of the
