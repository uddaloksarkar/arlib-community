# Pinned dynamics, marginals, and the local walk of a spin system

`Chains.Pinning` established that **conditioning does not leave the category**:
`pinWeight w Λ η` is again a nonnegative weight, so a conditional Gibbs measure
is a Gibbs measure.  This module cashes that observation in.  It does two
things.

First it *states* the instantiations.  Each is a one-liner, and that is exactly
the point: the pinned single-site update and the pinned Glauber dynamics are
reversible with respect to the conditional Gibbs measure and positive
semidefinite, with no new proof, and pinning twice is pinning once
(`gibbsPin_pinWeight_union`).  The local-to-global induction of §6 of the
monograph — Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, Eric Vigoda, *Spectral
Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov
Chains*, arXiv:2307.13826 (2023), cited below as [CSV23] — runs over *all*
pinnings simultaneously, so having these available uniformly in `Λ` and `η` is
what makes that induction expressible at all.

Second it builds the two objects the induction actually consumes, the
monograph's `π_{η,1}` and the local walk `Q_η` (both [CSV23]).  Both are
carried on (site, spin) pairs `V × S`, which
is the spin-system counterpart of the ground set of `Techniques.LocalWalk`, and
they are built here from *masses* rather than from conditional probabilities:
`siteMass w v s` is the total weight of the configurations with `σ v = s` and
`pairMass w u v a b` the total weight of those with `σ u = a` and `σ v = b`.
Writing `Q_η` with these numerators makes detailed balance a one-line symmetry
(`pairMass_comm`) instead of a computation with conditional probabilities, and
it keeps every degenerate branch (a pinned site, a null marginal) visibly zero.

Following the convention of the development, the definitions take a *general*
weight `w` together with the set `Λ` of already-pinned sites; the intended
instance is `w = pinWeight w₀ Λ η`, and the lemmas about pinned marginals are
stated in that form.  Nothing about the construction needs `w` to be pinned —
only the counting of free sites uses `Λ`.

* `gibbsPin`, `siteChainPin`, `glauberPin` — the conditional Gibbs measure and
  the two pinned chains, with **`glauberPin_reversible`**,
  `glauberPin_stationary`, **`glauberPin_nonnegDefinite`** and their
  `siteChainPin` counterparts, each inherited verbatim from `Chains.Glauber`.
* `Z_pinWeight_union`, **`gibbsPin_pinWeight_union`** — pinning twice is
  pinning once.
* `siteChainPin_of_mem` — a pinned site is a no-op, so `glauberPin` is the
  conditional Glauber dynamics *with holding probability* `|Λ|/|V|`.  Stated
  because anything that feeds a pinned gap into a local-to-global estimate has
  to know that factor is there.
* `siteMass`, `pairMass` — the one- and two-site masses, with `sum_siteMass`
  (`∑_s siteMass = Z`), `sum_pairMass`, **`pairMass_comm`** and
  `pairMass_le_siteMass`.
* `siteMarginal` — the single-site marginal of `gibbs w` as a `FinDist S`, with
  `siteMarginal_eq_Pr` (it really is the probability of `{σ | σ v = s}`) and the
  compatibility results **`siteMarginal_pinWeight_of_mem`** (the marginal at an
  already-pinned site is the point mass at `η v`) and
  `siteMarginal_pinWeight_insert` (pinning `v` to `s` and then looking at `v`
  gives the point mass at `s`).  `Z_pinWeight_insert` records the companion
  identity `siteMass (pinWeight w Λ η) v s = Z (pinWeight w (insert v Λ) …)`:
  the one-site marginal *is* the mass of the one-site-larger pinning.
* **`pinDist`** — the monograph's `π_{η,1}`: choose a free site uniformly, then
  a spin from its marginal.  Needs at least one free site, so
  `Λ.card < Fintype.card V` sits in the data, as `FinDist` demands.
* **`pinLocalWalk`** — the local walk `Q_η` on one-site extensions, mirroring
  `Techniques.LocalWalk.localWalk`, with `pinDist_mul_pinLocalWalk` (the
  detailed-balance cell), **`pinLocalWalk_reversible`**,
  `pinLocalWalk_stationary` and `pinLocalWalk_diag`.

* `pinGraph`, `mu_graphWeight_pinGraph`, `mu_graphWeight_insert_pinGraph`,
  `mu_graphWeight_insert_two_pinGraph` — the dictionary to the encoded
  simplicial complex of `Chains.LevelEncoding`, and hence
  **`pinDist_eq_linkDist`** and **`pinLocalWalk_eq_localWalk`**: the local walk
  built here on `V × S` and the one built in `Techniques.LocalWalk` on the
  ground set of the complex are the *same matrix*, entry by entry, degenerate
  rows included.  This is the consistency check between the two halves of the
  development, and it is what will let a bound proved for one be used for the
  other.

As in `Techniques.LocalWalk`, `Q_η` is *not* asserted to be positive
semidefinite: it is the non-backtracking walk and the assertion is false.
Positive semidefiniteness here belongs to `glauberPin` and `siteChainPin`.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## The pinned category is closed

Every object of `Chains.SpinSystem` and `Chains.Glauber` applied to
`pinWeight w Λ η` is an object of the conditional system.  The definitions here
are pure abbreviations; they exist so that downstream statements about "the
Glauber dynamics of the system conditioned on `η`" can be written without
repeating the `pinWeight_nonneg` plumbing. -/

single-site update at an *already pinned* site `v` is the identity row: the
conditional law of `σ v` given the rest is the point mass at `η v`, which is
where `σ` already is.

This is worth recording explicitly, because it means `glauberPin` is the Glauber
dynamics of the conditional system *with holding*: it picks uniformly among all
`|V|` sites, and the `|Λ|` pinned ones do nothing.  A chain that picks uniformly
among the `|V| - |Λ|` free sites is `glauberPin` sped up by the factor
`|V| / (|V| - |Λ|)`, and its Dirichlet form — hence its Poincaré constant —
differs by exactly that factor.  Anything that feeds a pinned Glauber gap into a
local-to-global estimate has to say which of the two it means. -/

/-! ## The distribution one site above a pinning

This is the monograph's `π_{η,1}` ([CSV23]): from the pinning `η`
on `Λ`, choose a free site `v ∉ Λ` uniformly at random and then a spin `s` from
the conditional marginal at `v`.  Only `j = 1` is ever used in the monograph and
only `j = 1` is built here.

The hypothesis `Λ.card < Fintype.card V` — at least one free site — sits in the
*data* rather than on the lemmas, because without it `p_sum` is false: this is
the same judgement call as `LocalWalk.linkDist`, and per the conventions of the
development a hypothesis genuinely needed for well-formedness belongs in the
definition. -/

/-! ## The local walk `Q_η`

The monograph's local walk ([CSV23]) at the pinning `η` on `Λ`:
from a free (site, spin) pair `(i, a)` it jumps to a *different* free site `j`
with a spin `b` drawn from the conditional law of `σ(j)` given `σ(i) = a`,
divided by the number `n - |Λ| - 1` of admissible sites.  It is
**non-backtracking**: the whole block `j = i` is zeroed, which is why the walk
is not positive semidefinite and why no such claim is made.

The guard structure mirrors `Techniques.LocalWalk.localWalk` exactly, and for
the same reason: the two degenerate rows (a pinned site, a null marginal) hold
in place purely so that the matrix is stochastic on all of `V × S`.  Note in
particular that `Q_η` is *not* the down-up walk of the pinned complex at the
bottom level — that walk is the independent sampler, as `Techniques.LocalWalk`
records. -/

for `i, j ∉ Λ` with `j ≠ i` and `siteMass w i a > 0`, and `0` when `j ∈ Λ` or
`j = i`.  The weight `w` is the already-pinned weight `pinWeight w₀ Λ η`, so the

/-! ## The bridge to the simplicial-complex side

`Techniques.LocalWalk` builds the local walk on the ground set of a weighted
complex, and `Chains.LevelEncoding` encodes a spin system as such a complex on
the ground set `V × S`.  So `Q_η` has been built twice, once on each side, and
the two constructions must agree.  They do — **on the nose**, not merely on the
support — and this section proves it.

The translation is `pinGraph Λ η = {(v, η v) : v ∈ Λ}`, the face encoding the
pinning.  Under it the three dictionary lemmas
`mu_graphWeight_pinGraph`, `mu_graphWeight_insert_pinGraph` and
`mu_graphWeight_insert_two_pinGraph` turn every `mu` occurring in `linkDist` and
`localWalk` into a `Z`, a `siteMass` or a `pairMass`.

The guards of the two definitions are *not* literally the same — `localWalk`
excludes `e' ∈ insert e τ` while `pinLocalWalk` excludes `j ∈ Λ` and `j = i` —
and the discrepancy is real: the pair `(j, b)` with `j ∈ Λ` and `b ≠ η j` is
outside the face but inside the pinned set.  It is harmless because such a pair
carries no mass at all, which is the content of the two zero lemmas
`pairMass_self_of_ne` and `siteMass_pinWeight_of_mem`. -/

/-- **`π_{η,1}` is `LocalWalk.linkDist` of the encoded complex.**  Every entry
agrees, including the ones the two definitions guard differently: a pair
`(v, s)` with `v ∈ Λ` but `s ≠ η v` lies outside the pinning face, so
`linkDist` reaches for its formula rather than returning `0` — but the mass it
finds there is `0` anyway. -/

/-- **`Q_η` is `LocalWalk.localWalk` of the encoded complex.**  The local walk of
the spin system at a pinning and the local walk of the induced weighted complex
at the corresponding face are the *same matrix*, entry by entry.

This is the spin-system counterpart of `LevelEncoding.spinDownUp_apply_graph`,
and unlike that result it needs no "on the support" caveat: the degenerate rows
of the two constructions coincide as well, because the pairs on which the guards
disagree carry no mass. -/
