# Progress paths: a quantitative hitting-time bound from a graph condition

`HittingTime` reduces "how long to hit `T`?" to the survival probabilities
`survive K T n x`, and `RankingSupermartingale` bounds them from a certificate.
This module bounds them from a purely *combinatorial* condition on the chain,
which is how the certificate gets built in the first place.

The condition is `HasProgressPaths K T q D`: from every state there is a path to
`T` of length at most `D`, **all of whose steps have probability at least `q`**.
Following such a path is a single event of probability at least `q ^ D`, so:

* `survive_le_of_hasProgressPaths` — `Pr_x[H_T > D] ≤ 1 - q ^ D`, uniformly in
  `x`;
* `EHT_le_of_hasProgressPaths` — `E_x[H_T] ≤ D / q ^ D`, by feeding that uniform
  bound to the submultiplicativity lemma `survive_mul_le` and summing the
  resulting geometric series in blocks of length `D`;
* `almostSureReach_of_hasProgressPaths` — and hence almost-sure reachability.

Stating the hypothesis in terms of a *path with a uniform edge bound* rather
than "every nonzero transition probability is at least `q`" is deliberate, and
it is what makes the module reusable.  The two are equivalent for the chain one
starts from, but the interesting applications perturb the chain: an estimated
kernel `K'` that is close to `K` need not have a uniform lower bound on its
nonzero entries — a spurious transition can carry arbitrarily small mass — while
it *does* still contain every progress path of `K`, with each edge weight
reduced by at most the estimation error.  `hasProgressPaths_of_le` is that
transfer, and it is the reason the bound survives estimation.

* `ReachInWith`, `HasProgressPaths` — the graph condition.
* `hasProgressPaths_of_le` — and it transfers to any kernel that dominates the
  progress edges.

The bridge from the usual "`p_min` bounds every nonzero transition" hypothesis
to this condition is `Techniques.ReachDistance`, which also supplies the
distance function `Dist` and the eccentricity `D`.

Everything is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.
