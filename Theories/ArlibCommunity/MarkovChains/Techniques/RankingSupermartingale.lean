# Ranking supermartingales: soundness and completeness

A **ranking supermartingale** (RSM) for a target set `T`, with slack `ε > 0`, is
a nonnegative function `V` on the state space that drops by at least `ε` in
expectation at every state outside `T`:

  `V ≥ 0`  and  `(K V)(x) + ε ≤ V(x)` for `x ∉ T`.

It is the standard certificate for almost-sure reachability.  This module proves
that it is **sound** and **complete** for a finite chain, and it does so without
any measure theory: the whole argument is the single crux inequality

  `ε · ∑_{k < n} Pr_x[H_T > k] ≤ V(x)`  for every `n`  (`sum_survive_le_of_isRSM`),

obtained by iterating the drift condition through the killed operator of
`HittingTime`.  Everything else is a corollary of it:

* `summable_survive_of_isRSM`, `EHT_le_of_isRSM` — the tail sums are bounded, so
  the expected hitting time is finite and at most `V(x) / ε`.  This is *stronger*
  than almost-sure reachability, and it comes out of the same one-line bound.
* `almostSureReach_of_isRSM` — **soundness**: an RSM forces `Pr_x[H_T > n] → 0`
  from every state.
* `isRSM_EHT` — **completeness**: when the expected hitting time is finite
  everywhere it is itself a `1`-RSM, by the recursion `EHT_recursion`.
* `exists_isRSM_iff` — the two directions assembled: an RSM exists **iff** `T` is
  reached almost surely *from every state*.

The quantifier in the last statement is load-bearing and is worth spelling out,
because the literature routinely states the equivalence with reachability from a
single initial state `x₀`.  That version is **false**: `not_isRSM_of_unreachable`
exhibits a two-state chain in which `T` is reached almost surely from `x₀` and
yet no RSM exists, because the defining inequality is imposed at *every* state
outside `T`, including states that `x₀` can never reach.  Restricting `V` to the
reachable part and extending it by `0` — the usual repair — does not work: the
extension violates the drift condition at exactly those states.

Everything is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

Three small facts about `killed` that the induction below uses repeatedly:
it is additive, homogeneous, and preserves nonnegativity along iterates. -/

a lower bound for `V`, and the drift condition passes to it. -/

/-- **The crux inequality.**  For an `ε`-RSM, the first `n` tail probabilities of
the hitting time sum to at most `V(x) / ε`:

  `ε · ∑_{k < n} Pr_x[H_T > k] ≤ V(x)`.

Everything in this module is a corollary.  The proof is an induction on `n`
inside the killed operator: `killed^n (1_{Tᶜ}·V) ≤ 1_{Tᶜ}·V - ε ∑_{k<n} survive k`,
and the left-hand side is nonnegative. -/

/-- **The maximal-inequality step, elementary.**  For an `ε`-RSM,

  `Pr_x[H_T > n] ≤ V(x) / (ε · n)`.

This is the quantitative heart of the classical argument — a nonnegative
supermartingale `Y_k = V(X_{k∧τ}) + ε·(k∧τ)` starting at `V(x)` satisfies
`Pr[sup_k Y_k ≥ λ] ≤ V(x)/λ`, applied at `λ = ε·n` — obtained here directly from
the crux inequality, since the survival probabilities are antitone: `n` terms of
the sum are each at least `survive n`. -/

/-! ## The quantifier is necessary

A single-initial-state version of `exists_isRSM_iff` is false.  The witness is
the two-state chain in which both states are absorbing and the target is the
initial state: reachability from `x₀` is trivial, and yet the RSM condition is
imposed at the *other* state, where no nonnegative function can satisfy it. -/

  P x y := if y = x then 1 else 0

  almostSureReach_of_mem _ _ (by simp)

/-- …and yet **no** ranking supermartingale exists for `(idChain, {true})`,
because the drift condition is imposed at `false`, which is absorbing.

Hence "an `ε`-RSM exists ⟺ `Pr_{x₀}[Reach T] = 1`" is false as stated; the
correct statement quantifies over all states (`exists_isRSM_iff`). -/
