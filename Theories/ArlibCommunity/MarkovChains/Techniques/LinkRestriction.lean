# Restriction to a link: the projections `f^{(k)}` commute with conditioning

`Techniques.LocalToGlobal` decomposes the top-level variance into the Dirichlet
forms of the down-up walks, using the projected family `f^{(k)}` defined by the
downward recursion `f^{(n)} = f`, `f^{(k)} = U_k f^{(k+1)}`.  Every remaining
step of §6.6 of the monograph is *local*: it works inside the link of a face `τ`
and uses, without proof, that the projections computed there are the ambient ones
with all the levels shifted by `|τ|` ("for `η ∈ Pinning_{k-1}` and `τ` on two
further vertices, `f_η^{(2)}(τ) = f^{(k+1)}(η ∪ τ)`").  This module proves that.

**The mechanism is a closed form for `f^{(k)}`.**  The recursion is opaque to
comparison, but what it computes is not: for a face `τ` of positive derived
weight,

  **`f^{(k)}(τ) = mu (w · f) τ / mu w τ = (∑_{σ ⊇ τ} w σ f σ) / (∑_{σ ⊇ τ} w σ)`,**

the conditional expectation of `f` given that the top face contains `τ`
(`levelFun_eq_div`).  Once both projections are ratios of derived weights, any
statement comparing a link projection with an ambient one reduces to
`LocalWalk.mu_starWeight`-style bookkeeping, and the numerator is handled by the
*same* lemma applied to the weight `w · f` — which satisfies the same support
hypothesis as `w`.  This is why the module needs no new counting.

**A star and a link, and only one of them is the monograph's.**  `LocalWalk.starWeight`
keeps the ambient dimension `n`; its faces of size `j` are all the `j`-subsets of
the top faces containing `τ`, *including subsets that meet `τ`*.  That is the
**star** of `τ`, and it is a perfectly good weighted complex — the restriction
theorem holds for it (`levelFun_starWeightNorm`).  But its level-`j`
distribution `LocalWalk.starPi w n j τ` is **not** the monograph's `π_{τ,j}`: it
gives every `j`-subface of `τ` itself the mass `1 / n.choose j`
(`starPi_apply_of_subset`).  The monograph's link has dimension `n - |τ|` and
lives on the faces disjoint from `τ`; it is built here as `linkShift` /
`linkShiftNorm`, and its level-`j` distribution `linkShiftPi` is `π_{τ,j}`,
audited at `j = 1` against `LocalWalk.linkDist` (`linkShiftPi_one_singleton`).
Both restriction theorems are proved, because both complexes occur.

Main declarations:

* `linkShift`, `linkShiftNorm` and `linkShift_nonneg`, `linkShift_supp`,
  `sum_linkShiftNorm` — the **honest link**: a weighted complex of dimension
  `n - |τ|` on the faces disjoint from `τ`, satisfying all three hypotheses of
  `Techniques.Levels`.
* **`mu_linkShift`** — `mu (linkShift v τ) ρ = mu v (τ ∪ ρ)`: the derived weights
  of the honest link are the ambient ones shifted by `τ`.  The one genuine
  reindexing of the module, along `σ ↦ σ \ τ` and `ρ ↦ τ ∪ ρ`.
* **`levelFun_eq_div`** — the closed form of the projection as a ratio of derived
  weights, with `mu_mul_levelFun` for the version valid at null faces.
* **`levelFun_starWeightNorm`** and `levelFun_starWeightNorm_disjoint` — the
  restriction theorem for the star: `(f_τ)^{(j)}(ρ) = f^{(|τ ∪ ρ|)}(τ ∪ ρ)`, and
  for `ρ` disjoint from `τ`, `= f^{(|τ| + j)}(τ ∪ ρ)`.
* **`levelFun_linkShiftNorm`** — the same for the honest link, where the shift
  `j ↦ j + |τ|` is literal and the restricted function is `σ ↦ f (τ ∪ σ)`.
* `linkShiftPi`, `linkShiftPi_apply_of_disjoint`, **`linkShiftPi_one_singleton`**
  — the monograph's `π_{τ,j}`, and the check that at `j = 1` it agrees with the
  independently built `LocalWalk.linkDist`.
* `linkShiftPi_eq_zero_of_not_disjoint`, `starPi_apply_of_subset` — the two
  lemmas that separate `π_{τ,j}` from `LocalWalk.starPi w n j τ`.
* `sum_ite_disjoint_union` — the reindexing of `mu_linkShift`, isolated so that
  it applies to a summand other than a derived weight.
* `linkShiftPiOf`, `linkShiftPiOf_eq_linkShiftPi` — the **guarded-total**
  `π_{τ,j}`, total in `τ` so that it can appear inside a `π_k`-average, with
  `Ex_linkShiftPi_congr` and `Var_linkShiftPi_congr` for the partial agreement on
  the support.  Unlike `LocalWalk.linkDistOf` it needs no `[Nonempty E]`: its
  state space is `Finset E`, which always contains `∅`.
* `linkLevelFun`, `linkLevelFun_eq_levelFun` — the guarded-total `f_τ^{(j)}`,
  together with the restriction theorem in guarded form.
* `Var_linkShiftPi_succ_eq` and **`Var_linkShiftPi_two_eq`** — the one-step
  variance identity of `Techniques.LevelVariance` inside the link, at the level
  pair `(1, 2)` that `claim:first-step` uses.
* `levelVar_sub_levelVar_eq_add` — the left-hand side of `claim:first-step`,
  `Var_{π_{k+2}}(f^{(k+2)}) − Var_{π_k}(f^{(k)})`, as the sum of two level
  energies of `Techniques.LocalToGlobal`.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; in particular
no eigenvalue, and no spectral theorem, appears anywhere.

/-! ## Attaching a face to a small face of its link

Every face of the link of `τ` is read in the ambient complex as `τ ∪ ρ`, so the
level-one and level-two computations keep meeting `τ ∪ {e}` and
`τ ∪ {e, e'}`; these are the two rewrites that put them in `insert` form. -/

structure, placed first for the same reason `LocalWalk.starWeight` is: it is a

Unlike `LocalWalk.starWeight`, which keeps the ambient dimension `n` and whose
faces are all the subfaces of the top faces containing `τ`, this is the *link* in
the simplicial sense: a weighted complex of dimension `n - |τ|` whose faces are
the faces of the ambient complex disjoint from `τ`.  It is the complex the
monograph's `π_{τ,j}` lives on, and it is the construction in which the level
shift `j ↦ j + |τ|` is literal rather than implicit. -/

/-- **The projection `f^{(k)}` is a ratio of derived weights.**  For a face `τ`
of cardinality `k` and positive derived weight,

  **`f^{(k)}(τ) = (∑_{σ ⊇ τ} w σ · f σ) / (∑_{σ ⊇ τ} w σ)`**,

that is, `f^{(k)}(τ) = mu (w · f) τ / mu w τ`: the conditional expectation of `f`
given that the top face contains `τ`.

The monograph *defines* `f^{(k)}` by the downward recursion `f^{(k)} = U_k f^{(k+1)}`,
and this is the closed form that recursion computes.  Everything in this module
is a corollary: two projections agree exactly when the two ratios do, and ratios
of derived weights are trivial to compare across a link because
`LocalWalk.mu_starWeight` says the star's derived weights are the ambient ones
shifted by `τ`.

Note that the hypothesis `k ≤ n` is *not* needed: `0 < mu w τ` already forces
`τ.card ≤ n` (`card_le_of_mu_pos`).  The proof is an induction on the recursion
depth `n - k`; the inductive step is `Levels.sum_ite_mu_level_succ` applied to the
weight `w · f`, which satisfies the same support hypothesis as `w`.  Null faces
one level up need no separate argument: their up-transition probability and their
`mu (w · f)` both vanish. -/

every `ρ` of cardinality `j`, and every `f` on the top level,

where the left side is the level-`j` projection computed *inside the link of `τ`*
— that is, for the weighted complex `starWeightNorm w τ` — and the right side is
the ambient projection.

Both sides are the conditional expectation of `f` given that the top face
contains `τ ∪ ρ`, by `levelFun_eq_div`: the link's derived weights are the
ambient ones shifted by `τ` (`LocalWalk.mu_starWeightNorm`), the same holds for
the weight `w · f` (`mu_mul_starWeightNorm`), and the two normalising factors
`mu w τ` cancel in the ratio.

Note that no restriction operation is applied to `f` itself: the link of `τ` is a
complex on the *same* ground set and of the *same* dimension `n`, so a function
on its top level is literally a function on the top level of the ambient complex.
The only hypothesis is `0 < mu w (τ ∪ ρ)`, which is exactly the condition under

`claim:first-step` (§6.6, "then `f_η^{(2)}(τ) = f^{(k+1)}(η ∪ τ)`", for
`|η| = k - 1`): conditioning on a face of size `|τ|` shifts every level by
`|τ|`.  The disjointness hypothesis is what turns `|τ ∪ ρ|` into `|τ| + j`; it

/-- **The derived weights of the shifted link are the ambient ones shifted by
`τ`**: `mu (linkShift v τ) ρ = mu v (τ ∪ ρ)` for `ρ` disjoint from `τ`.

This is the analogue of `LocalWalk.mu_starWeight` for the honest link, and it is
the only combinatorial content of this section.  Where `mu_starWeight` is a
one-line consequence of `Finset.union_subset_iff`, this one is a genuine
reindexing: the faces `σ ⊇ τ ∪ ρ` of the ambient complex correspond to the faces
`σ \ τ ⊇ ρ` of the link, under the mutually inverse maps `σ ↦ σ \ τ` and
`ρ' ↦ τ ∪ ρ'`.

It is stated for an arbitrary weight `v` because it is needed twice: once for
`v = w`, and once for `v = w · f`, which is what carries the *function* across
the link in `levelFun_linkShiftNorm`. -/

The two constructions above give two different level-`j` distributions at a face
`τ`, and it matters which one a downstream statement means.  The following two
lemmas make the difference explicit and checkable, on the faces where they
disagree most visibly: the subfaces of `τ` itself. -/

level-`j` distribution of `LocalWalk.starWeightNorm w τ` — gives every `j`-subset
of `τ` itself the mass `1 / n.choose j`.

Together with `linkShiftPi_eq_zero_of_not_disjoint` this is a proof that
`starPi w n j τ ≠ linkShiftPi w n j τ` as soon as `τ` has a nonempty subface of
size `j`, i.e. as soon as `0 < j ≤ |τ|`.  It is recorded because the two are
easily confused: `starPi w n 2 τ` looks like the monograph's `π_{τ,2}` and is
not.  The intuitive reason is that `starWeightNorm w τ` is the complex of *all*
subfaces of the top faces containing `τ` — the star of `τ`, of dimension `n` —
whereas the monograph's link has dimension `n - |τ|`. -/

/-! ## The guarded-total link distribution and link projection

`linkShiftPi w n j τ …` needs `0 < mu w τ` and `τ.card + j ≤ n` in its data, so
a `π_k`-average over *all* faces `τ` of a quantity built from it does not
typecheck, even though the offending faces carry no `π_k`-mass.  The two
definitions here remove the obstruction exactly as `LocalWalk.linkDistOf`
does: guard both hypotheses, fall back on a junk value, and record that the
junk is invisible where the real object exists.

Unlike `linkDistOf` neither definition needs a nonemptiness hypothesis: the
state space of `π_{τ,j}` is `Finset E`, which contains `∅` however small `E`
is. -/

/-- The **guarded-total level-`j` link distribution**: `linkShiftPi`
where that is defined, and the point mass at `∅` elsewhere.

Unlike `linkShiftPi` this is a total function of the face `τ`, so it can appear
inside a `π_k`-average.  The junk value is invisible to every statement below,
because a face at which either guard fails has `π_k`-mass `0`. -/

/-! ## The one-step identity inside the link

With `linkShiftNorm` established as a weighted complex of dimension `n - |τ|`,
every result of `Techniques.Levels`, `Techniques.LevelVariance` and
`Techniques.LocalToGlobal` applies to the link verbatim.  The one the monograph
needs is `LevelVariance.Var_pi_succ_eq`, at `k = 1`: it relates the level-`2`
variance in the link — the `Var_{π_{τ,2}}` of `claim:first-step` — to the
level-`1` variance and the Dirichlet form of the link's own down-up walk. -/

/-- **The one-step variance identity inside the honest link.**  For every
`k < n - |τ|` and every `g`,

  `Var_{π_{τ,k+1}}(g) = Var_{π_{τ,k}}(U^τ_k g) + ℰ_{P^{∨∧,τ}_k}(g)`.

This is `LevelVariance.Var_pi_succ_eq` applied to `linkShiftNorm w τ`, and it
costs one line: the whole point of the shifted link is that it is again a
weighted complex, so it needs no new theory. -/

/-- **The two-levels-up identity.**  The case `k = 1` of
`Var_linkShiftPi_succ_eq`:

  `Var_{π_{τ,2}}(g) = Var_{π_{τ,1}}(U^τ_1 g) + ℰ_{P^{∨∧,τ}_1}(g)`.

This is the identity `claim:first-step` and `lem:improved-technical` use inside
the link of a face `τ` at level `k - 1`, with `g = f_τ^{(2)}`; by
`levelFun_linkShiftNorm` that `g` is the restriction of the ambient `f^{(k+1)}`,
and by `levelFun_linkShiftNorm` again its projection `U^τ_1 g` is the
restriction of `f^{(k)}`. -/

/-! ## The left-hand side of `claim:first-step`

The telescoping of `Techniques.LocalToGlobal` already computes the two-level
variance drop that the monograph's `claim:first-step` starts from.  Recorded here
because it is the other half of that claim, and because it is one line. -/

/-- **The two-level variance drop is a sum of two level energies**:

  `Var_{π_{k+2}}(f^{(k+2)}) − Var_{π_k}(f^{(k)}) = ℰ_{P^{∨∧}_{k+1}}(f^{(k+2)}) + ℰ_{P^{∨∧}_k}(f^{(k+1)})`.

This is the left-hand side of the monograph's `claim:first-step` (§6.6, there
written with `k + 1` and `k - 1` in place of `k + 2` and `k`), obtained by
applying the one-step identity `LocalToGlobal.levelVar_succ` twice.  What
`claim:first-step` adds is that this quantity is also the `π_k`-average of the
local variances `Var_{π_{τ,2}}(f_τ^{(2)})`. -/
