# Wilson's sinusoidal potential, and the hole walk of Huber's bounding chain

This module supplies the potential that `Techniques.PotentialDecay` consumes:
Wilson's *sinusoidal* Lyapunov function for a lazy nearest-neighbour walk on
`{0, 1, …, m}` that is absorbed at `0`.  With

  `C := π / (2 (n - 1))`,   `Φ(i) := sin(C i) / sin C`,

the function `Φ` is `0` at the absorbing state, at least `1` everywhere else in
range, at most `2n/π` throughout, increasing, and — the point of the whole
construction — an *exact* eigenfunction of the discrete Laplacian:

  `Φ(i - 1) + Φ(i + 1) = 2 cos(C) · Φ(i)`.

That identity is the sum-of-angles formula `sin(θ - c) + sin(θ + c) =
2 cos c · sin θ` and nothing more, and it converts the one-step expectation of
`Φ` into `(1 - p(2 - 2 cos C)) Φ(i)` exactly, where `p` is the probability of
stepping towards the absorbing end.

This is Theorem 5 of M. Huber, *Fast perfect sampling from linear extensions*,
Discrete Mathematics **306**(4) (2006) 420–428 — cited below as [Hub06] — which
in turn adapts the analysis of the Karzanov–Khachiyan chain ([KK91]: A. V.
Karzanov, L. G. Khachiyan, *On the conductance of order Markov chains*, Order
**8**(1) (1991) 7–15) in D. B. Wilson, *Mixing times of lozenge tiling and card
shuffling Markov chains*, Ann. Appl. Probab. **14**(1) (2004) 274–325, cited
below as [Wil04].

## Contents

* `sinC`, `sinPot` — the constant and the potential.
* `sinC_pos`, `sinC_le_pi_div_two`, `sin_sinC_pos`, `sinPot_zero`,
  `sinPot_nonneg`, `one_le_sinPot`, `sinPot_mono`, `sinPot_le` — the range
  bounds, all of them consequences of `sin` being increasing and concave on
  `[0, π/2]`.
* `sinPot_second_diff` — the second-difference identity.  Everything below is
  downstream of this one line.
* `sinPot_drift_of_le`, `sinPot_drift` — the one-step drift inequality, stated
  as a pure arithmetic fact with no kernel in sight, for a general forward rate
  and for Huber's `p = 1/(2(n-1))` respectively.
* `two_sub_two_cos_lower`, `pi_sq_div_le_drift`, `contraction_le_exp` — the
  numeric contraction factor `1 - p(2 - 2 cos C) ≤ exp(-π² / (8 n³))`.
* `contraction_le_exp'`, `hole_not_absorbed_le` — the assembly: the shifted
  constant that survives the reflecting boundary, and the hitting-time tail
  bound for the hole walk.

## Two places where the argument needed care

**Smaller backward drift only helps.**  Huber's chain has right-move probability
exactly `p = 1/(2(n-1))` but a left-move probability `q` that can be *smaller*
than `p` (in the TPA variant of the algorithm the parameter `β` reduces it).
The literature disposes of this by a stochastic-domination remark.  Here it is a
direct computation: writing the one-step expectation as
`Φ(i) + p(Φ(i-1) - Φ(i)) + q(Φ(i+1) - Φ(i))` and using `Φ(i+1) - Φ(i) ≥ 0`
(`sinPot_mono`), replacing `q` by the larger `p` only increases the expression.
So `sinPot_drift` takes `0 ≤ q ≤ p` as a hypothesis and needs no domination
argument at all.

**The reflecting boundary.**  The drift inequality needs `sinPot` to be
increasing *one step past* the state under consideration, i.e. `i + 1 ≤ n - 1`.
At the top state `i = n - 1` the walk cannot move away from the goal, so `q = 0`
there — but that does *not* rescue the inequality: with `C = π/(2(n-1))` one has
`Φ(n-2) = cos(C) Φ(n-1)`, so the one-step factor at the top is
`1 - p(1 - cos C)`, only *half* the interior contraction `1 - p(2 - 2 cos C)`.
Huber's proof asserts the interior factor at every state and is therefore short
of a case at the reflecting end.  The repair costs nothing: run the *same*
potential with the constant belonging to `n + 1` rather than `n`, i.e.
`C' = π/(2n)`.  Then `sinPot (n+1)` is increasing on `{0, …, n}`, the drift
inequality applies at every state of `{0, …, n-1}` including the top, and the
contraction factor is still at most `exp(-π²/(8n³))` (`contraction_le_exp'`) —
Huber's constant is recovered exactly.  `hole_not_absorbed_le` is stated with
that corrected constant.

Everything here is elementary: `sin`, `cos`, one Taylor bound, and no
eigenvalues (the "eigenfunction" above is an eigenfunction of a difference
operator exhibited by hand, not produced by a spectral theorem).  No `sorry`.

weak: it yields `1/sin C ≤ n - 1`, and `n - 1 > 2n/π` as soon as `n ≥ 3`.  The
cubic Taylor bound `sin x > x - x³/4` (`Real.sin_gt_sub_cube`) is exactly enough,
because the claim reduces to `n · C² ≤ 4`.  The case `n = 2` is separate only
because there `C = π/2` is too large for that Taylor bound; it is immediate since
`sin(π/2) = 1`. -/

This is the crux.  Everything below is a consequence of the single line

eigenfunction of the discrete Laplacian:

  `Φ(i-1) + Φ(i+1) = 2 cos(C) · Φ(i)`   for `i ≥ 1`.

No hypothesis on `n` is needed: if `sin C = 0` both sides are `0`.  The

/-! ## The one-step drift inequality

Stated as a pure arithmetic fact about `sinPot`: no kernel, no probability
space.  A caller supplies the identification of the left-hand side with a
one-step expectation. -/

/-- **The one-step drift inequality, for an arbitrary forward rate.**  Let `p`
be the probability of stepping *towards* the absorbing state `0`, and `q ≤ p`
the probability of stepping away.  Then one step multiplies the potential by at
most `1 - p(2 - 2 cos C)`.

*The proof.*  Rewrite the left-hand side as
`Φ(i) + p(Φ(i-1) - Φ(i)) + q(Φ(i+1) - Φ(i))`.  The last bracket is nonnegative
(`sinPot_mono`), so replacing `q` by the larger `p` only increases the whole
expression; what is left is `Φ(i) + p(Φ(i-1) - 2Φ(i) + Φ(i+1))`, and
`sinPot_second_diff` evaluates that second difference as `(2 cos C - 2)Φ(i)`.

*Why `q ≤ p` rather than `q = p`.*  Huber's chain moves the hole away from the
goal with probability exactly `p`, but the TPA variant of the algorithm damps
that rate by its parameter `β`, and the literature then appeals to stochastic
domination to say that a smaller backward rate can only help.  The monotonicity
argument above proves it directly, with no coupling and no domination.

The hypothesis `i + 1 ≤ n - 1` is genuinely needed: it is what makes
`sinPot_mono` available.  At the reflecting top state `i = n - 1` the conclusion
is **false** even with `q = 0`; see the module docstring. -/

/-! ## The shifted constant, and the reflecting boundary

Running the potential of index `n + 1` on a walk whose states are `{0, …, n-1}`
buys monotonicity one step past the top state, which is exactly what the drift
inequality needs there.  It costs nothing: the contraction factor is still at
most `exp(-π²/(8n³))`. -/

forward rate is still the chain's `p = 1/(2(n-1))` but the potential is the one

`pi_sq_div_le_drift`: it reduces to `π² ≤ 32 n`. -/

/-! ## Assembly: the hitting-time bound for the hole walk -/

/-- **[Hub06, Thm 5], single hole.**  Let `K` be a chain on
`{0, 1, …, n-1}` — read as the distance of a "hole" of the bounding chain from
the right-hand end — with

* `0` absorbing (`hzero`: row `0` puts no mass off `0`);
* every other row supported on `{i-1, i, i+1}` (`hsupp`);
* the step towards `0` taken with probability exactly `p = 1/(2(n-1))`
  (`hdown`);
* the step away from `0` taken with probability at most `p` (`hup`).

Then, started anywhere, the probability of not having been absorbed at `0`
after `t` steps is at most `(2(n+1)/π) · exp(-t π² / (8 n³))`.

The potential used is `sinPot (n+1)`, not `sinPot n`: see the module docstring
for why the reflecting top state `i = n-1` forces the shift, and
`contraction_le_exp'` for the fact that the shift costs nothing in the
exponent. -/
