# Spectral independence, without the spectrum

The source monograph defines spectral independence as a bound `λ_max(Ψ) ≤ 1 + η`
on the largest eigenvalue of an influence matrix `Ψ`.  That formulation cannot
be used here (see `docs/dev/MarkovChains-ROADMAP.md` §1.2), and it does not need to be: the monograph
itself proves that the eigenvalue bound is *equivalent* to a semidefinite
ordering between the covariance form of `μ` and the diagonal form of its
marginals, because `Cov = D · Ψ` with `D` diagonal.  We take that ordering as
the definition, which removes `Ψ`, the spectrum, and the diagonal square roots
`D^{±1/2}` from the development in one step.

The state space is the configuration space `V → S` of a spin system with finite
site set `V` and spin set `S`, and the index type of every form below is the set
`V × S` of (site, spin) pairs — the same indexing the monograph uses for the
local walk and for the multi-spin influence matrix.  The measure `μ` is an
arbitrary `FinDist (V → S)`; nothing here needs it to be a Gibbs measure, and
marginals are built directly from `Pr` rather than from the pinning machinery.

The organising identity is `quadForm_Cov`: the covariance form evaluated at `a`
is the *variance* of the linear statistic `σ ↦ ∑_v a (v, σ v)`.  Every other
result is a corollary — positive semidefiniteness of `Cov` becomes
`Var_nonneg`, with no matrix theory anywhere.

* `marg μ` — the pair marginal `μ(σ v = s)`, indexed by `V × S`.
* `joint μ` — the pair joint probability `μ(σ v = s ∧ σ u = t)`; `Psd (joint μ)`
  is immediate from `psd_weighted_rankOne`.
* `Cov μ` — the covariance form `joint − marg ⊗ marg`, with `Cov_symm` and
  `Cov_sum_right` (each row of a block sums to zero, so the form is genuinely
  degenerate — this is why no normalisation by `D^{-1}` is possible or wanted).
* **`quadForm_Cov`** — `quadForm (Cov μ) a = Var μ (σ ↦ ∑_v a (v, σ v))`,
  and hence **`psd_Cov`**.
* **`SpectralIndependence μ η`** — the ordering `Cov μ ⪯ η · diag (marg μ)`.
  *The constant differs from the monograph's by one*: this `η` is the
  monograph's `1 + η`.  See the note below `SpectralIndependence`.
* `SpectralIndependence.mono`, `one_sub_marg_le_of_spectralIndependence` (the
  order forces `η ≥ 1 − μ(σ v = s)`), and the crude universal bound
  **`spectralIndependence_card`** with `η = |V|`.
* **`spectralIndependence_of_pairwiseIndep`** — the calibration point: a measure
  whose coordinates are pairwise independent satisfies the condition with
  `η = 1`, i.e. with the monograph's `η = 0`, and by
  `one_sub_marg_le_of_spectralIndependence` that is optimal as soon as some
  marginal is small.  The proof exhibits `diag (marg μ) − Cov μ` as a sum of
  rank-one forms, one per site.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`, and no
eigenvalue appears anywhere.

A vector `a : V × S → ℝ` acts on a configuration through the indicators of the
events `σ v = s`; the resulting random variable is the general "linear
statistic" of the configuration, and its variance is what the covariance form
below computes. -/

/-- **Spectral independence, as a semidefinite ordering.**

`μ` is `η`-spectrally independent when the covariance form is dominated by `η`
times the diagonal form of the marginals.

*Why this is the eigenvalue-free form.*  On the index set `V × S` the influence
matrix is `Ψ((v,s),(u,t)) = μ(σ u = t | σ v = s) − μ(σ u = t)`, and multiplying
by the marginal at `(v,s)` gives exactly `Cov = D · Ψ` for `D = diag (marg μ)`.
Hence `D^{1/2} Ψ D^{-1/2} ⪯ η I`, i.e. `λ_max(Ψ) ≤ η`, is literally
`Cov ⪯ η · D`.  Nothing is lost and `Ψ`, the spectrum and the square roots
`D^{±1/2}` all disappear.

*Constant convention.*  The monograph's condition is `λ_max ≤ 1 + η`, so the `η`
here is the monograph's `1 + η`; a product measure satisfies
`SpectralIndependence μ 1`, the monograph's `0`-spectral independence.  The
shift is unavoidable once the eigenvalue is dropped, because `Ψ` has unit
diagonal while `Cov` does not, and carrying the monograph's normalisation would
mean writing `1 + η` at every use site with no gain.

*Relation to the monograph's `n × n` matrix (two spins).*  For `S` a two-element
type the condition above is *equivalent*, with the same constant, to the
monograph's `Cov_μ ⪯ (1+η) diag(Var_μ)` on the `|V| × |V|` covariance matrix of
the indicators `X_v = 1[σ v = 1]`: the quadratic form on `V × S` depends on `a`
only through the differences `b v = a (v,1) − a (v,0)`, and minimising
`p·a(v,1)² + (1−p)·a(v,0)²` at fixed `b v` returns exactly `Var(X_v)·(b v)²`.
So this is the monograph's *spectral* independence, not the weaker notion
attached to `diag` of the means in the `n × n` indexing. -/

satisfies `SpectralIndependence μ η` for `η < 1/2`, so the value `η = 1` reached

/-! ### The universal bound

Some constant always works.  Cauchy–Schwarz on the `|V|`-term sum defining the
linear statistic gives `η = |V|`, and that bound is **attained**: for `μ`
uniform on the two constant configurations the ratio is `|V|`, as the test
vector `a (v, true) = 1/2`, `a (v, false) = -1/2` shows — variance `|V|²/4`
against diagonal form `|V|/4`.

(An earlier version of this comment said `|V|/2`.  That is wrong, and
disprovably so: `Chains/TwoSiteSpectralIndependence.lean` proves
`twoSiteConst_eta_eq_card` — the constant is exactly `2` at `|V| = 2` — together
with `twoSiteConst_not_spectralIndependence_one`, which refutes the `η = 1` that
`|V|/2` would predict there.) -/

/-! ### Calibration: pairwise independent coordinates

The definition is only worth anything if the extreme case comes out with the
extreme constant.  It does, and with the weakest possible hypothesis: only
*pairwise* independence of the coordinates is used, since the covariance form
sees nothing else.  The proof exhibits `diag (marg μ) − Cov μ` as a sum of one
rank-one form per site, so the ordering is not merely true but manifestly so. -/

def PairwiseIndep (μ : FinDist (V → S)) : Prop :=
  ∀ p q : V × S, p.1 ≠ q.1 → joint μ p q = marg μ p * marg μ q

/-- Under pairwise independence the covariance form is block diagonal, and its
defect from the diagonal of marginals is a sum of rank-one forms, one per
site. -/
