# The distance to a target, and the `p_min` hypothesis

The combinatorial layer under `ProgressPath`: reachability along
positive-probability transitions, the shortest-path distance `Dist` to the
target, and its maximum `ecc` (the target's eccentricity).

Together these turn the classical hypothesis *"every nonzero transition
probability is at least `p_min`"* into the `HasProgressPaths` condition that
`ProgressPath` bounds hitting times from: a shortest path is made of
positive-probability edges, each of which then has probability at least `p_min`.

* `ReachIn`, `Reaches`, `dist`, `ecc` — the graph notions.
* `ecc_lt_card` — the eccentricity of a reachable target is *less than the
  number of states*: the reachable-set sequence `R 0 ⊆ R 1 ⊆ ⋯` grows strictly
  until it stabilises, and it lives inside a set of size `|Ω|`.  This is what
  makes a sample budget depend on `|Ω|` alone.
* `hasProgressPaths_of_minProb` — the bridge.

Everything is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

all `m ≥ n`, and a strictly increasing chain of subsets of `Ω` starting from the
