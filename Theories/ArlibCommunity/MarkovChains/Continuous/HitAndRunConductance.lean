# Theorem 4.2 of Lovász–Vempala: the conductance of hit-and-run

> L. Lovász and S. Vempala, *Hit-and-Run from a Corner*, STOC 2004 / SIAM J. Comput. 35
> (2006) 985–1005, `https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/papers/start.pdf`, §4.

> **Theorem 4.2.** Let `K` be a convex body in `ℝⁿ` of diameter `D`, containing a unit
> ball.  Then the conductance of hit-and-run in `K` is at least `1/(2²⁴·n·D)`.

Formally, `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_hitAndRun_ge`:

    ENNReal.ofReal (1 / (2 ^ 27 * n * D)) ≤ conductance (hitAndRun K) (uniformOn volume K)

with `conductance` the genuine infimum of `Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/Conductance.lean`
and `hitAndRun` the kernel of `Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRun.lean`.

**`2²⁷`, not the paper's `2²⁴`, and the reason is a constant and nothing else.**  Lemma 3.3
is proved in this repository (`Arlib.lem33_sqrt`) at `10·t√n/2r` rather than the paper's
`t√n/2r`, so Lemma 3.4 reads `∫_K s ≥ ((1−α)/(10√n))·vol K`; that factor `10` propagates
verbatim to the headline, giving `1/(122880000·n·D)`, and `122880000 > 2²⁴ = 16777216`.  The
factor `10` is a constant-factor loss in the exponential-envelope majorant that
`KLS97Sharp.lean`'s route uses in place of the Gaussian — **not** an error in KLS 1997, whose
`C = 1` is consistent with everything proved here.  The order in `n` and `D` is the paper's.

This file assembles that theorem — `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_hitAndRun_ge` — around
**two inline `∀`-hypotheses**, and proves everything else.  The two are *not* on the
same footing, and the difference is the point of this file:

## 1. `hIso` — the open gap, **and a correction to the paper**

`hIso` is the paper's **Theorem 2.1**, the weighted isoperimetric inequality, specialised
to the uniform density (which is all Theorem 4.2 consumes):

> Let `S₁, S₂, S₃` partition the convex body `K` and let `h : K → ℝ₊` satisfy
> `h(x) ≤ (1/3)·min(1, d_K(u,v))` for every `u ∈ S₁`, `v ∈ S₂` and every `x` on the chord
> of `K` through `u` and `v`, **and `h ≤ 1/3` on all of `K`**.  Then
> `π(S₃) ≥ E_π(h)·min(π S₁, π S₂)`.

### The emphasised clause is not in the paper, and Theorem 2.1 is FALSE without it

The printed hypothesis constrains `h` only on the union of the chords through cross pairs,
while the conclusion integrates `h` over all of `K`; for `n ≥ 2` that union can miss a set
of positive measure, on which `h` is unconstrained.  `Arlib.not_hIso_two`
(`Arlib/Convexity/LovaszVempalaIsoFalse.lean`) is the **negation of the binder as it was
previously written here**, machine-checked at `n = 2` and `K = [0,4]²`, with
`T₁ = [0,1/2]²`, `T₂ = [7/2,4]×[0,1/2]` and `h = 1000·1_{[0,4]×[4/3,4]}`: no cross chord
rises above height `7/6`, so `h` vanishes on every one of them, yet
`E_π(h)·min(π T₁, π T₂) = 125/12 > 1 ≥ π(K ∖ T₁ ∖ T₂)`.  `Arlib.cexK_hitAndRun_hypotheses`
checks that this `K` satisfies *every other* hypothesis of `conductance_hitAndRun_ge`, so the
old binder made this theorem **vacuous at that instance**.

The repair costs the argument nothing: the paper's own §4 application verifies `h ≤ 1/3`
("clearly"), and that step is `Arlib.MarkovChains.weight_le_third` here — in the stronger
form `h ≤ 1/(24√n)`.  It is discharged at the use site inside
`conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv`, so no caller has to supply it.
`Arlib.cexH_not_le_third` confirms the new clause is exactly what kills the counterexample.
`Arlib.not_hIso_two_measurable` further shows that adding `Measurable h` would **not** be a
repair — the counterexample weight is measurable — which is why no measurability binder was
added; the repo has no measurability lemma for `Arlib.stepRadius` to discharge one with.

### What remains open, and it is not Borsuk–Ulam

Lovász–Vempala prove Theorem 2.1 by a single invocation of the Localization Lemma
(Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits 1995, Corollary 2.4) on a *signed* pair of integrands.  Earlier
versions of this docstring said the signed case "is where Borsuk–Ulam re-enters" and that
Borsuk–Ulam is absent from Mathlib; **that is stale**.  `Arlib.exists_flat_cut_zero_pos`
(`Arlib/Convexity/LocalizationAssembly.lean:370`) takes **arbitrary signed** integrands
`g₁ g₂ : E → ℝ` — its only hypotheses on them are `IntegrableOn`, `∫_C g₁ = 0` and
`0 < ∫_C g₂` — and delivers a cut with `∫ g₁ = 0` and `0 < ∫ g₂` on one side.  With the
equality-refined form only **one** integrand is ever bisected, by a one-parameter
intermediate value theorem (`Arlib.exists_pencil_bisecting`); the other needs no bisection
because its two masses sum to something positive.  No Borsuk–Ulam is used anywhere.

Everything in §2 of the paper except that invocation is now proved, in
`Arlib/Convexity/LovaszVempalaIso.lean`: `Arlib.oneDim_crossRatio_partition` (the
one-dimensional cross-ratio inequality for measurable partitions), `Arlib.needle_iso` (the
repaired one-dimensional Theorem 2.1) and `Arlib.needle_iso_of_chord` (Theorem 2.1 on a
needle inside `K`, unconditional).  `Arlib.thm21_of_localization` is Theorem 2.1 for the
uniform density with the Localization Lemma as its single binder.

The residuals are the two that `Arlib/Convexity/LocalizationAssembly.lean` classifies as
open, and both moved today:

* **(C) lower semicontinuity** — `Arlib/Convexity/LocalizationLSC.lean` runs the needle with
  `g₂` bounded *lower semicontinuous*.  This is only half of what Theorem 2.1 needs: the
  `g₁` slot carries an **equality** and `g₁ = 1_{T₁} − A·1_K` is merely measurable, which
  that file's own boundary discussion shows is not reachable (a needle is a null set, and the
  equality does not transfer even for open `S`).
* **(F) the Euclidean transport and nondegeneracy** — closed in
  `Arlib/Convexity/LocalizationTransport.lean`
  (`Arlib.exists_needleIntegral_eq_zero_and_pos_of_compact_chain_euclidean`, via
  `PiLp.volume_preserving_toLp`), with nondegeneracy closed modulo one explicit `hsep`.

`hIso` is written out **inline, as a `∀`-hypothesis of the theorem that consumes it** — not a
named `Prop`, not a `structure` field, not a `class`.  A reader of
`conductance_hitAndRun_ge`'s type sees the inequality in full.  Compare
`../gaussian-cooling-vempala/lean/Isoperimetry.lean`, which "has" isoperimetry only through
an `IsoInput`/`OneDimIso` predicate that assumes its own conclusion; that is exactly the
mistake this file refuses to make — and the counterexample above is why writing the binder
out in full matters: it is what made the error findable.

## 2. `hLem41` — a placeholder for work in flight, not a gap

`hLem41` is **temporary**, and is being proved concurrently in this same repository.  It is
threaded here in the same inline style purely so that this file can be built and audited
before it lands; when it does, it is discharged by a single application.

`hLem41` is the paper's **Lemma 4.1**, the one-step overlap bound: two points that are close
in cross-ratio distance *and* close relative to their median step lengths have overlapping
one-step distributions.  It is being proved in
`Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRunOverlap.lean`.

It is not an obstruction of the kind `hIso` is: it is ordinary (if laborious) geometry that
the surrounding development already knows how to do.  As of writing that concurrent file does
not discharge it *at the paper's constant*, and the difference is recorded here rather than
hidden: `tvLe_hitAndRun_lemma41` obtains `1 − 1/2880` rather than the paper's `1 − 1/500`
(its cap constant is `1/2`, not the paper's erroneous `1/6`), and it hypothesises
`|u−v| < (2/√n)·F(u)` rather than the paper's `max{F(u),F(v)}` — the latter follows by
symmetry, since `TVLe` and `crossRatioDist` are symmetric.  **This is why the theorem below
is stated twice**: once parametrically in the Lemma 4.1 loss
(`conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv`, giving `lam/(245760·n·D)` from `d_TV ≤ 1 − lam`), and once
at the paper's `lam = 1/500` (`conductance_hitAndRun_ge`, giving `1/(2²⁷·n·D)`).  At
`lam = 1/2880` the same theorem gives `1/(707788800·n·D)`, i.e. roughly `1/2³⁰·n·D`.

## 3. `hLem33` — discharged; no longer a hypothesis of this file

The paper's **Lemma 3.3** (= Corollary 4.6 of Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits 1997), quoted without
proof by Lovász–Vempala, **is proved in this repository**, as
`Arlib.lintegral_volume_closedBall_sdiff_le_sqrt` in `Arlib/Convexity/KLS97Sharp.lean` (its
inradius-`1` specialisation being `Arlib.lem33_sqrt`).  It used to be threaded through this
file as an inline `∀`-hypothesis `hLem33`, because `Arlib.lintegral_stepRadius_ge` carried one
of exactly that shape; `StepLength.lean` now discharges it internally from
`hball : closedBall z 1 ⊆ K` — the paper's own "Suppose `K` contains a unit ball" — and **no
`hLem33` binder survives anywhere in this file.**

What is proved is the `10√n` form, not the paper's `√n`.  That is a constant-factor loss in
the majorant of the proof route in `KLS97Sharp.lean` (an exponential envelope `e^{2−λh}` in
place of the Gaussian, plus `(1+x)ⁿ − 1 ≤ nx·e^{nx}`), **not** an error in KLS97.  The order
is `√n`, as in the paper; only the absolute constant differs, and the whole cost downstream is
the factor `10` in the headline recorded at the top of this docstring.

## What is proved here

Everything else in §4:

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.stepRadius_le_two_mul_diam` — `s_α(x) ≤ 2·diam K` for `α ≥ 1/2`.
  This is the paper's unargued "clearly `h(x) ≤ 1/3`".
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.stepRadius_le_of_chord` — **the chain of §4**, in the chord
  coordinate:

      s(x) ≤ (|x−p|/|u−p|)·s(u) ≤ 32(|q−p|/|u−p|)·F(u) ≤ 16√n·|u−v|·(|q−p|/|u−p|)
           = 16·d_K(u,v)·√n·|q−v| ≤ 16·d_K(u,v)·D√n,

  for every `x` on the chord through `u` and `v`.  It uses Lemma 3.1 (concavity, as
  `Arlib.theta_mul_stepRadius_le`), Lemma 3.2 (`Arlib.stepRadius_le_medianStep`), and the
  hypothesis `|u−v| ≥ (2/√n)·max{F(u),F(v)}` that the failure of Lemma 4.1 supplies.  The
  paper writes only the case "`x` between `u` and `q`" and says "e.g."; both cases are
  proved here, the second by the mirror-image argument through `v` and `q`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.weight_le_of_chord` — the verification of Theorem 2.1's hypothesis
  for `h(x) = s(x)/(48·D·√n)`, in both branches of the dichotomy (`d_K(u,v) ≥ 1/8`, or the
  separation bound above).
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.one_le_diam_of_unitBall` — `diam K ≥ 1` for a body with inradius `1`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv` — **Theorem 4.2, parametric in the
  Lemma 4.1 loss**: `d_TV ≤ 1 − lam` gives `Φ ≥ lam/(245760·n·D)`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_hitAndRun_ge` — **Theorem 4.2**, at `lam = 1/500`:
  `Φ ≥ 1/(2²⁷·n·D)`.

## Reused rather than rebuilt

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance` (`Conductance.lean`) — the genuine infimum.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.hitAndRun`, `isReversible_hitAndRun` (`HitAndRun.lean`).
* `Arlib.stepRadius_concaveOn`, `theta_mul_stepRadius_le`, `lintegral_stepRadius_ge`
  (`StepLength.lean` — Lemmas 3.1 and 3.4).
* `Arlib.stepRadius_le_medianStep`, `medianStep` (`HitAndRunStep.lean` — Lemma 3.2).
* `Arlib.crossRatioDist` and the chord coordinate (`CrossRatio.lean`).
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.mul_measure_add_measure_le_mul_flow` (`BallWalkConductance.lean`) —
  the three-way-partition flow accounting, stated there for an arbitrary reversible Markov
  kernel on an arbitrary measurable space.  It is exactly the accounting §4 needs.

## Constants, and where they differ from the paper

The headline constant is `1/(2²⁷·n·D)` where the paper writes `1/(2²⁴·n·D)`.  **The entire
difference is the factor `10` in the proved Lemma 3.3**; every other step of the bookkeeping
here is the paper's or slightly better than it:

| quantity | paper | here |
|---|---|---|
| Lemma 3.3 | `t√n/2r` | `10·t√n/2r` (proved, `KLS97Sharp.lean`) |
| `∫_K s / vol K` | `> 1/4000·nD` after `1/(48D√n)` | `≥ 1/(30720·n·D)` (exact `48·64·10`) |
| escape flow | `≥ (1/2000)·vol(S₃')` | same |
| final | `1/2²⁴·nD` | `1/(122880000·n·D) ≥ 1/2²⁷·nD` |
| general | — | `lam/(245760·n·D)` from `d_TV ≤ 1 − lam` |

The paper reaches `2²⁴` as `2²³` times a factor `2` for `vol(Sᵢ') ≥ vol(Sᵢ)/2`; here the
same factor `2` appears one step earlier, as `π(S) ≤ 2·min(π S₁', π S₂')`, and the
arithmetic lands at `500·245760 = 122880000 ≤ 2²⁷ = 134217728`.  Absent the factor `10` the
same route would land at `12288000 ≤ 2²⁴`, i.e. exactly the paper's statement; that factor is
a constant-factor loss in a majorant, not a discrepancy with KLS97 (see §3 above).

## Two places where the formalisation is more careful than the paper

1. **Interior points.**  `S₁'` and `S₂'` are cut down to `interior K`.  Two of the inputs
   genuinely need it: at a boundary point `u` the chord endpoint `p` *is* `u`, so the
   cross-ratio distance `d_K(u,v) = |u−v||p−q|/(|p−u||v−q|)` divides by zero (Lean returns
   the junk value `0`, which would make Theorem 2.1's hypothesis unsatisfiable), and
   Lemma 3.2 needs `hitAndRunProposal K u univ = 1`, which
   `Arlib.hitAndRunProposal_univ_eq_one_of_mem_interior` supplies only at an interior
   point.  Nothing is lost: `Convex.addHaar_frontier` gives `vol(K \ interior K) = 0`.
2. **`h(x) ≤ 1/3`.**  The paper says "clearly".  It is `s(x) ≤ 2·diam K`, proved here from
   `α ≥ 1/2` and `K ⊆ closedBall x (diam K)`; the resulting `h(x) ≤ 1/(24√n)` is what makes
   *both* branches of the dichotomy go through, including the `d_K(u,v) ≥ 1/8` branch where
   the paper's "trivial" needs `1/(24√n) ≤ 1/24`.

## Scope

There is no mixing-time statement here.  `Arlib.MarkovChains.mixesWithin_of_conductance`
(`L2Mixing.lean`) is what would consume this bound, and it additionally needs a
nonnegative-spectrum hypothesis, which for hit-and-run is a separate question (the lazy
version of `BallWalkConductance.lean` is the standard fix).  This file stops at the
conductance, which is what Theorem 4.2 is.

If `t` is admissible at `x ∈ K` then `α·vol(tB) ≤ vol(K ∩ (x + tB)) ≤ vol K ≤ vol(Δ·B)`

`α ≥ 1/2` and `n ≥ 1` this is `tⁿ ≤ 2·Δⁿ ≤ (2Δ)ⁿ`, i.e. `t ≤ 2Δ`.

For `h(x) = s_α(x)/(48·D·√n)` and any `x ∈ K`, `s_α(x) ≤ 2·diam K ≤ 2D`
(`Arlib.MarkovChains.stepRadius_le_two_mul_diam`) and `48·D·√n ≥ 48·D`, so
`h(x) ≤ 2D/(48D√n) = 1/(24√n) ≤ 1/24 ≤ 1/3`.

It appears inside `Arlib.MarkovChains.weight_le_of_chord` as an intermediate step, but it is
needed on its own now: the `hIso` binder of the theorems below carries `∀ x ∈ K, h x ≤ 1/3`

`Arlib.not_hIso_two` (`Arlib/Convexity/LovaszVempalaIsoFalse.lean`).  This lemma is what

/-! ## 2. The chain of §4 -/

/-- **The chain of §4 of Lovász–Vempala**, in the chord coordinate.

Let `u, v` be interior points of a convex body `K`, and suppose the separation
`|u−v| ≥ (2/√n)·max{F(u), F(v)}` holds — i.e. `F(u), F(v) ≤ (√n/2)·|u−v|`, which is what
the *failure* of the paper's Lemma 4.1 supplies.  Then for **every** point `x` on the chord
of `K` through `u` and `v`,

    s_α(x) ≤ 16·√n·d_K(u,v)·diam K.

The paper's own chain, with `p, u, v, q` in order along the chord, is

    s(x) ≤ (|x−p|/|u−p|)·s(u) ≤ 32(|q−p|/|u−p|)·F(u) ≤ 16√n·|u−v|·(|q−p|/|u−p|)
         = 16·d_K(u,v)·√n·|q−v| ≤ 16·d_K(u,v)·D√n,

and it is run here in the chord parameter: with `a = chordLow < 0`, `b = chordHigh > 1` and
`L = |u−v|`, one has `|x−p| = (t−a)L`, `|u−p| = (−a)L`, `|q−p| = (b−a)L`, `|v−q| = (b−1)L`
and `d_K(u,v) = (b−a)/((−a)(b−1))`, so every ratio becomes a scalar identity.

The first `≤` is Lemma 3.1 (`Arlib.theta_mul_stepRadius_le`) with
`θ = |u−p|/|x−p| = (−a)/(t−a)`, the second is Lemma 3.2
(`Arlib.stepRadius_le_medianStep`), the third is the separation hypothesis.

The paper writes only "let e.g. `x` be between `u` and `q`"; the mirror case `x` between
`p` and `u` is proved here too, by running the same argument through `v`, `q` and `F(v)`
(the parameter `θ' = (b−1)/(b−t)`), which is why both `hFu` and `hFv` appear. -/

/-! ## 3. Theorem 2.1's hypothesis, verified for `h(x) = s(x)/(48·D·√n)` -/

/-- **The weight function of §4 satisfies Theorem 2.1's hypothesis.**

With `h(x) = s_α(x)/(48·D·√n)` and `α = 63/64`, for interior points `u ≠ v` of `K` and any
`x` on the chord of `K` through them,

    h(x) ≤ (1/3)·min(1, d_K(u,v)),

*provided* the dichotomy `hcase` holds: either `d_K(u,v) ≥ 1/8`, or the separation
`F(u), F(v) ≤ (√n/2)·|u−v|`.  That dichotomy is exactly what the failure of the paper's
Lemma 4.1 supplies at a pair of "deep" points.

Both branches also need `h(x) ≤ 1/3`, which the paper calls clear: it is
`h(x) ≤ 2·diam K/(48·D·√n) ≤ 1/(24√n) ≤ 1/24` from
`Arlib.MarkovChains.stepRadius_le_two_mul_diam`.  In the first branch that bound *is* the
whole argument, since `(1/3)·min(1, d_K) ≥ (1/3)·(1/8) = 1/24`. -/

/-! ## 4. Theorem 4.2 -/

/-- **Theorem 4.2 of Lovász–Vempala, parametric in the Lemma 4.1 loss.**  For a convex body
`K ⊆ ℝⁿ` containing the unit ball and of diameter at most `D`, the conductance of
hit-and-run on `K` is at least `lam/(245760·n·D)` when Lemma 4.1 holds with loss `lam`.

**Two hypotheses carry content, and they are not on the same footing.**

* `hIso` — **the open gap, in its corrected form.**  It is the paper's Theorem 2.1, the
  weighted isoperimetric inequality, specialised to the uniform density: for a partition
  `T₁, T₂, (K \ T₁) \ T₂` of `K` and a nonnegative weight `h` bounded by
  `(1/3)·min(1, d_K(u,v))` on every chord joining `T₁` to `T₂` **and by `1/3` on all of
  `K`**, the middle piece has mass at least `E_π(h)·min(π T₁, π T₂)`.

  The second bound is **not** in the paper, and Theorem 2.1 is false without it:
  `Arlib.not_hIso_two` refutes the uncorrected binder at `n = 2`, `K = [0,4]²`.  It is
  discharged at the use site below by `Arlib.MarkovChains.weight_le_third`, so it costs no
  caller anything; see §1 of the module docstring.

  What is still assumed is one invocation of the Localization Lemma (KLS 1995, Cor. 2.4) on
  a signed pair of integrands — **not** Borsuk–Ulam, which
  `Arlib.exists_flat_cut_zero_pos` shows is not needed.  Everything else in §2 of the paper
  is proved in `Arlib/Convexity/LovaszVempalaIso.lean` (`Arlib.needle_iso`,
  `Arlib.needle_iso_of_chord`, `Arlib.thm21_of_localization`).  `hIso` is written out inline
  here, as a `∀`-hypothesis, precisely so that it cannot be mistaken for something proved —
  and that is what made the paper's error findable.

* `hLem41` — **not a gap; work in flight.**  The paper's Lemma 4.1: two points close in
  cross-ratio distance *and* close relative to their median step lengths have one-step
  distributions at total variation distance less than `1 − 1/500`.  It is being proved in
  `Arlib/MarkovChains/Continuous/HitAndRunOverlap.lean`.  `Arlib.TVLe μ ν ε` is this
  repository's total-variation bound (`Arlib/Probability/TV.lean`), i.e. `d_TV(μ,ν) ≤ ε`;
  the paper's strict `<` is weakened to `≤`, which is all the proof consumes.

  It is demanded only on `interior K`, which is where the proof below applies it (`S₁'` and
  `S₂'` are cut down to the interior; see §1 of *Two places where the formalisation is more
  careful than the paper*).  That restriction is not cosmetic: the `∀ u ∈ K` form is
  **unreachable**, because the side condition `chordLow K u v < 0` of the proved Lemma 4.1
  is false at every boundary point (`Arlib.MarkovChains.chordLow_eq_zero_of_notMem_interior`).
  On the interior the binder is discharged outright, at `1 − 1/8000` for `n ≥ 1100`, by
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.hLem41_interior_uncond`; `conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv` below is this
  theorem with the binder restored to `∀ u ∈ K` for backward compatibility.

**The paper's Lemma 3.3 is no longer among them.**  It used to appear here as a third inline
hypothesis `hLem33`, forwarded to `Arlib.lintegral_stepRadius_ge`.  That hypothesis is
**discharged**: Lemma 3.3 is proved in `Arlib/Convexity/KLS97Sharp.lean`
(`Arlib.lintegral_volume_closedBall_sdiff_le_sqrt`, specialised as `Arlib.lem33_sqrt`), and
`StepLength.lean` now consumes it internally from `hball`.  No `hLem33` binder remains.  The
price is its constant: the proved form is `10·t√n/2r`, which is why the conclusion below has
`245760` where the paper's arithmetic gives `24576`.

The remaining hypotheses are the standing geometric side conditions of the paper's own
statement: `K` convex, closed, measurable and bounded, containing a unit ball
`closedBall z 1` (at an arbitrary centre, as in the paper), of diameter at most `D`, and
`1 ≤ n`.  `hball` now does double duty: besides non-degeneracy — `0 < vol K` and
`1 ≤ diam K ≤ D` — it is what discharges Lemma 3.3 inside
`Arlib.lintegral_stepRadius_ge`, which is stated at inradius `r = 1`.  That is exactly the
paper's own "Suppose `K` contains a unit ball" for Lemma 3.4.

**Non-vacuity, stated honestly.**  No witness for the hypothesis bundle is exhibited here,
and none can be until `hIso` is proved.  This is not a formality: in the shape `hIso` had
before the `∀ x ∈ K, h x ≤ 1/3` clause was inserted, the bundle was **provably
unsatisfiable** at `n = 2`, `K = [0,4]²` (`Arlib.not_hIso_two`,
`Arlib.cexK_hitAndRun_hypotheses`), i.e. the theorem was vacuous there.  With the clause the
binder is the corrected Theorem 2.1, whose one-dimensional and needle forms are proved
(`Arlib.needle_iso`, `Arlib.needle_iso_of_chord`) and whose remaining content is a single
invocation of the Localization Lemma (`Arlib.thm21_of_localization`).  What *can* be said
otherwise is that no hypothesis is degenerate on its face — `hLem41` is discharged by the
paper's Lemma 4.1, and the geometric side conditions hold for, say, the unit ball itself. -/

/-- **Theorem 4.2 with `hLem41` demanded on all of `K`** — the shape this theorem had before
`conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv_interior` was split off, kept verbatim so that every existing
consumer continues to typecheck.

The proof is the whole content of the claim that the split is a *strengthening*: a caller
holding Lemma 4.1 on all of `K` gets it on `interior K` by `interior_subset`, so nothing that
could be proved from this statement is lost by the weaker binder.  The converse fails, and
that is the point: **the `∀ u ∈ K` form is not obtainable from the paper's Lemma 4.1.**
`Arlib.MarkovChains.tvLe_hitAndRun_lemma41_uncond` (`SphereCap.lean`) needs
`chordLow K u v < 0`, and for `u ∈ frontier K` and `v ∈ interior K` that is *false*: a point
`u + t(v−u) ∈ K` with `t < 0` would put `u` on an open segment between a point of `K` and an
interior point, hence in `interior K`.  So `chordLow K u v = 0` there, for every body, in
every dimension.  On `interior K` the same side condition is
`Arlib.chordLow_neg_of_mem_interior`, and the discharged binder is
`Arlib.MarkovChains.hLem41_interior_uncond` (`HitAndRunLem41Discharge.lean`). -/

/-- **Theorem 4.2 of Lovász–Vempala, at the paper's Lemma 4.1 constant.**

    Φ(hit-and-run on K)  ≥  1/(2²⁷·n·D).

This is `Arlib.MarkovChains.conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv_interior` at the paper's Lemma 4.1 loss
`lam = 1/500`, where the general bound reads `1/(500·245760·n·D) = 1/(122880000·n·D)`.

**Why `2²⁷` and not the paper's `2²⁴`.**  The exact constant the proof delivers is
`122880000`, and `122880000 > 2²⁴ = 16777216`, so the paper's power of two is *not* what this
route proves and is not claimed.  The statement is rounded up to the next power of two,
`2²⁷ = 134217728 ≥ 122880000`, purely for legibility — the exact form
`1/(122880000·n·D)` is available by rerunning the final comparison, and is strictly stronger.

The whole gap to the paper is one factor `10`: the proved Lemma 3.3
(`Arlib.lem33_sqrt`) reads `10·t√n/2r` where the paper writes `t√n/2r`, so Lemma 3.4 reads
`∫_K s ≥ ((1−α)/(10√n))·vol K`, and `10 · 12288000 = 122880000`.  That `10` is a
constant-factor loss in the exponential-envelope majorant used by `KLS97Sharp.lean` — **not**
an error in KLS 1997, and not a change in the order of the bound, which remains the paper's
`1/(n·D)` up to an absolute constant.

Read the docstring of `conductance_hitAndRun_ge_of_tv_interior` for the classification of the
hypotheses: `hIso` is the **open gap, in its corrected form** (the paper's Theorem 2.1, which
is *false* as printed — `Arlib.not_hIso_two` — and which needs the Localization Lemma on
signed integrands, but **not** Borsuk–Ulam); `hLem41` is a placeholder for
work in flight elsewhere in this repository; and the paper's Lemma 3.3 is **proved**, in
`Arlib/Convexity/KLS97Sharp.lean`, and is no longer a hypothesis of either theorem. -/
