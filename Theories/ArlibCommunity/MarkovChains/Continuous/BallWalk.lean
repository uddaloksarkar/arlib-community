# The ball walk on a convex body, as a Markov kernel

Cousins-Vempala, *Gaussian cooling and `O*(n^3)` algorithms for volume and Gaussian
volume*, section 4.1 (`../gaussian-cooling-vempala/vol3_journal.tex:514-746`), define the
**ball walk with `δ`-steps** on a convex body `K ⊆ ℝⁿ`: from the current point `x`, pick
`y` uniformly at random from the ball `x + δBₙ`, move to `y` if `y ∈ K`, and otherwise
stay at `x`.  This module builds that walk as a genuine `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel` on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, and proves the two structural facts a conductance argument
needs before it can start: the kernel is Markov, and the uniform measure on `K` is
reversible — hence invariant — for it.

The Metropolis filter of the paper's Figure 2 is *not* applied here: this is the
unweighted (uniform-target) ball walk, which is the `P^unif` of `lem:overlap`
(`vol3_journal.tex:582`).

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ell K δ x = vol(x + δBₙ ∩ K) / vol(δBₙ)` — the **local
  conductance** at `x` (`vol3_journal.tex:293`), the probability that the proposed point
  is accepted.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ballWalk K δ` — **the ball walk kernel**.  On a measurable `K` it
  is `(vol(x + δBₙ))⁻¹ • volume.restrict (x + δBₙ ∩ K) + (1 - ℓ(x)) • dirac x`: the
  uniform proposal restricted to `K`, plus an atom at `x` carrying exactly the rejected
  mass.  On a non-measurable `K` — where the proposal is not a kernel at all — it is the
  identity kernel, so that `ballWalk` is a total function of `K` and `δ`; every lemma
  below that says anything about its value carries `MeasurableSet K`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.SpeedyPoints K δ = {x | 3/4 ≤ ℓ(x)}` — the points from which the
  walk moves with probability at least `3/4`; the speedy-walk analysis
  (`vol3_journal.tex:829`) discards the rest.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.avgLocalConductance K δ` and `Arlib.MarkovChains.IsSmooth K δ s` —
  the **average local conductance** `λ = (∫_K ℓ)/vol(K)` of `vol3_journal.tex:848`, and
  the statement that `K` is `(δ, s)`-smooth, i.e. `λ ≥ 1 - s`.

## Main results

* `Arlib.MarkovChains.isMarkovKernel_ballWalk` — **the ball walk is a Markov kernel**,
  for every `K` and every `δ`, including the degenerate `δ ≤ 0` (where the proposal ball
  is empty and the walk is the identity).
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.ballWalk_apply_compl_singleton` — **the walk moves with probability
  exactly `ℓ(x)`**: `P_x({x}ᶜ) = ℓ(x)`.  This needs `[NeZero n]`; see the warning below.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.lintegral_volume_inter_ball_comm` — the crux:
  `∫_A vol(B ∩ ball x δ) dx = ∫_B vol(A ∩ ball x δ) dx`, because `y ∈ ball x δ` iff
  `x ∈ ball y δ`.  Proved by evaluating both sides as the Lebesgue measure of one
  symmetric subset of `ℝⁿ × ℝⁿ` and applying `Measure.prod_swap`.
* `Arlib.MarkovChains.isReversible_ballWalk`, `Arlib.MarkovChains.invariant_ballWalk` —
  **detailed balance for the uniform measure on `K`**, and therefore (via the landed
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.IsReversible.invariant`) its invariance.  No convexity, no
  isoperimetry, and no bound on `δ` is needed: reversibility is exactly the symmetry of
  the ball relation above.

## Degenerate cases: two warnings

**`n = 0`.**  `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` is a single point of `volume` one, so `{x}` is
*not* null and the walk "stays put" with probability one while `ℓ(x) = 1`.  The identity
`P_x({x}ᶜ) = ℓ(x)` is therefore **false** at `n = 0`, and
`ballWalk_apply_compl_singleton` carries `[NeZero n]`.  Nothing else in the file does:
the kernel, its Markov property, and reversibility are all correct at `n = 0`.

**`δ ≤ 0` and null `K`.**  `ℝ≥0∞` divides by zero to zero, so `ell K δ x = 0` when the
proposal ball is null, and the kernel degenerates to `dirac x` — still Markov, still
reversible, but with nothing to say.  Likewise `Arlib.uniformOn volume K` is the *zero*
measure unless `0 < volume K < ⊤`, in which case `isReversible_ballWalk` is a true
statement about the zero measure.  The witnesses in the last section discharge all of
these guards at once on the unit ball.

## Scope: what is deliberately absent

There is **no conductance bound and no mixing bound here, in any form** — not as a
theorem, not as an assumed predicate, not as a definition whose name asserts one.  The
Cousins-Vempala conductance bound `Φ = Ω(δ/(σ√n))` (`thm:speedyconductance`,
`vol3_journal.tex:624`) rests on the isoperimetric inequality for log-concave densities,
which Mathlib does not have and which `Arlib/Convexity/Isoperimetry.lean` deliberately
stops short of; see `CV-ROADMAP.md` section 3.  A predicate named after that bound would
be inhabited only by degenerate witnesses, which is the trap `CV-ROADMAP.md` section 2a
records.  What this file supplies is the object such a bound would be *about*.

/-- **`x ↦ vol(B ∩ (x + δBₙ))` is measurable.**  This is the one genuinely
measure-theoretic ingredient in turning "pick a uniform point of the ball" into a
`Kernel`: the map is the `x`-section of the measurable subset
`{(x, y) | y ∈ B ∧ dist x y < δ}` of `ℝⁿ × ℝⁿ`, so `measurable_measure_prodMk_left`
applies. -/

/-! ## The local conductance -/

/-- The **local conductance** at `x`,
`ℓ(x) = vol(K ∩ (x + δBₙ)) / vol(x + δBₙ)` (`vol3_journal.tex:293`): the fraction of the
proposal ball that lies inside `K`, equivalently the probability that a single step of
the ball walk from `x` actually moves (`ballWalk_apply_compl_singleton`).

The denominator is the volume of the ball *centred at `x`*, which by translation
invariance (`volume_ball_eq`) is the `vol(δBₙ)` of the paper.  Because `ℝ≥0∞` divides by
zero to zero, `ell K δ x = 0` whenever `δ ≤ 0`; that is the same convention under which
the kernel degenerates to `dirac x`, so the two agree. -/

subset of `x + δBₙ`.  (`0 ≤ ℓ(x)` is automatic in `ℝ≥0∞`.)  This is what makes the
stay-put mass `1 - ℓ(x)` in the definition of the kernel an exact complement rather than
a truncated subtraction that loses information. -/

/-- The **`δ`-neighbourhood relation between `A` and `B`**,
`{(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B, dist x y < δ}` as a subset of `ℝⁿ × ℝⁿ`.  It exists only to
carry the symmetry of `dist` into a measure-theoretic statement: its two marginal
integrals are the two sides of `lintegral_volume_inter_ball_comm`, and swapping the
coordinates exchanges `A` and `B`. -/
def nearRel (A B : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) (δ : ℝ) :
    Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) × EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :=
  {p | p.1 ∈ A ∧ p.2 ∈ B ∧ dist p.1 p.2 < δ}

/-- **Swapping the coordinates exchanges the two sets.**  This is `dist_comm`, and it is
the entire mathematical content of reversibility of the ball walk. -/

/-- **The `x`-sections of `nearRel` compute the integral.**  `(vol × vol)(nearRel A B δ)`
equals `∫_A vol(B ∩ ball x δ) dx`, because the section over `x ∈ A` is `B ∩ ball x δ` and
the section over `x ∉ A` is empty. -/

/-- **The crux: the ball relation is symmetric.**

    ∫_A vol(B ∩ (x + δBₙ)) dx = ∫_B vol(A ∩ (x + δBₙ)) dx.

Both sides are the Lebesgue measure of `nearRel` on `ℝⁿ × ℝⁿ` (`prod_nearRel`), and
`Measure.prod_swap` together with `preimage_swap_nearRel` identifies the two relations.
This single identity is what makes the ball walk reversible: it says that the transition
density `1[dist x y < δ]/vol(δBₙ)` is symmetric in `x` and `y`. -/

and returns the rejected mass `1 - ℓ(x)` to the current point.  `ballWalk` is the version
that does not carry the measurability proof; use that one. -/

/-! ## The speedy walk and smooth bodies

Two plain definitions.  Neither carries an assumed conclusion: nothing below asserts a
conductance, a mixing time, or any bound on the quantities it names. -/

/-- The **points of high local conductance**, `{x | ℓ(x) ≥ 3/4}`.

The speedy walk of `vol3_journal.tex:829` is the subsequence of *proper* steps of the
ball walk — those on which the proposed point lands in `K` — and its analysis is driven
by the points where that happens often.  `3/4` is the threshold at which
`vol3_journal.tex:551` (`lem:f-dist`) controls the ratio `ℓ(u)/ℓ(v)` for nearby `u, v`.

This is a plain definition: **nothing about the speedy walk's conductance or mixing is
asserted anywhere in this file.** -/

/-- The **average local conductance** `λ = (∫_K ℓ(x) dx) / vol(K)`
(`vol3_journal.tex:848`) — for the uniform density, the expected fraction of steps of the
ball walk that are proper.  It governs the number of *wasted* steps, which is the only
role it plays in Cousins-Vempala; no bound on it is proved or assumed here. -/
noncomputable def avgLocalConductance (K : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) (δ : ℝ) : ℝ≥0∞ :=
  (∫⁻ x in K, ell K δ x) / volume K

/-- **`K` is `(δ, s)`-smooth**: the average local conductance for `δ`-steps is at least
`1 - s`, written multiplicatively as `(1 - s)·vol(K) ≤ ∫_K ℓ`.

The multiplicative form is the robust one — it says the right thing at `vol(K) ∈ {0, ⊤}`,
where the quotient of `avgLocalConductance` would be junk; `isSmooth_iff_le_avg` proves
the two agree on `0 < vol(K) < ⊤`.

This is a plain definition.  It asserts nothing: `IsSmooth K δ s` is a hypothesis a
caller supplies, never a conclusion this file provides for a general `K`.
`isSmooth_unitBall` proves one concrete non-trivial instance of it. -/
