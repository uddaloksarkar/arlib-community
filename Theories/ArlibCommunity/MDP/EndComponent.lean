# End components, the no-EC condition, and reachability from `s₀`

    An **end component** is a non-empty set `C ⊆ S × A` that is
      (i)  *closed*: `(s,a) ∈ C` and `P(s' ∣ s,a) > 0` imply `(s',a') ∈ C` for some `a' ∈ A(s')`;
      (ii) *strongly connected*: the subgraph it induces links any two of its
           states via transitions within `C`.

    **Assumption (No-EC).**  No end component contains a pair `(s,a)` with
    `s ∈ Sₙₜ`.

`ReachIn M C` is the reachability relation of the subgraph induced by `C`:
`ReachIn M C s t` holds when `t` is reachable from `s` along transitions
`(x,a) ∈ C` of positive probability.  Strong connectivity is then
`∀ p q ∈ C, ReachIn M C p.1 q.1`.

## Reachability from `s₀`, and `AllReachable`

The same relation, taken over `C = SAnt` — the *enabled* pairs at *non-terminal*
states, i.e. exactly the transitions the algorithm's walk can take — and started
at `M.init`, is the standard "reachable from `s₀`":

    Reachable M s  ↔  ReachIn M SAnt s₀ s .

`AllReachable` says every state is.  It is a **well-formedness condition on the
model**, and it is load-bearing for any learning algorithm whose step sizes are
driven by visits: at a non-terminal state `s` that the walk started at `M.init`
can never occupy, the applied step size `α_t(s,a)` is `0` at *every* `t` and
every sample point, so `∑_t α_t(s,a) = 0` and the Robbins–Monro divergence
hypothesis at `(s,a)` is outright **false** rather than merely unproved.  A
model can satisfy `NoEC` and still fail `AllReachable` — a three-state MDP with a
non-terminal state carrying no incoming transition does — so the two conditions
are genuinely independent.  Nothing in this area consumes `AllReachable`; it is
here because it is the condition that excludes those models.

/-! ## Reachability from `s₀` -/

/-- **`s` is reachable from `s₀`** — the standard phrase, read as `ReachIn` over
`SAnt`: there is a finite sequence of positive-probability transitions from
`M.init` to `s`, each taken at a non-terminal state along an enabled action.
Those are precisely the transitions the algorithm's walk can make: at a terminal
state the episode ends and the next one restarts at `s₀` (lines 15 and 7 of the
source paper's pseudocode; the paper is not identified in this library — see
`Arlib/MDP.lean`). -/
