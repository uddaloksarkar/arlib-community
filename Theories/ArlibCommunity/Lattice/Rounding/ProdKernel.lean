# The product kernel of independent coordinatewise randomized rounding

`ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.tent` is the displacement density of randomized rounding in a
single coordinate. Rounding each coordinate of `p ∈ ℝⁿ` independently therefore
has kernel

  `k p x = Pr[rnd p = x] = ∏ᵢ tent (pᵢ − xᵢ)`,

which this file calls `ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.prodTent x p`, read as a function of the
*continuous* variable `p` for a *fixed* lattice point `x`.

The headline is `ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.integral_prodTent`:

  `∫ p, prodTent x p = 1`  for every fixed `x`.

This is **double stochasticity**. It is emphatically not the trivial statement
`∑ₓ k p x = 1` (each `p` rounds somewhere); it says that, seen as a function of
`p` with the lattice point held fixed, the kernel is again a probability density.
That is exactly what yields the *upper* bound `Pr[rnd p = x] ≤ 1 / Vol(P')` in
Theorem 2 of Kannan–Vempala, *Sampling Lattice Points* (STOC '97), and it is the
reason the sampling argument works at all.

The proof is Fubini over the product measure — `volume` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`
is `Measure.pi` transported along the `PiLp` identification — followed by
translation invariance and `ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.integral_tent` in each coordinate.

The supporting facts describe the support: the density vanishes off the paper's
side-2 cube `C(x,1) =` `ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.roundBox x`, which sits inside the closed
ball of radius `√n` about `x`; hence compact support, hence integrability.

/-- **Double stochasticity of the rounding kernel.**

`∫ p, prodTent x p = 1` for every *fixed* lattice point `x`: the kernel, read as a
function of the continuous variable, is itself a probability density.

This is the nontrivial direction of stochasticity — the trivial one is that each
`p` rounds to *some* lattice point. It is what supplies the upper bound
`Pr[rnd p = x] ≤ 1 / Vol(P')` in Theorem 2 of Kannan–Vempala.

Proof: `volume` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is the product measure, so Fubini
factors the integral of the product into a product of one-variable integrals, and
each of those is `1` by `ArlibCommunity.Lattice.Rounding.integral_tent_sub`. -/
