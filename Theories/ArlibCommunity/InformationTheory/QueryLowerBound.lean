# An abstract adaptive query lower bound

This file assembles the information-theoretic pieces of the area into the
standard skeleton of a query lower bound. Nothing new is proved about entropy
here; the whole content is the way four existing results compose.

The situation: a hidden parameter `X` is drawn uniformly from `α`, an algorithm
issues `q` adaptive queries and records their answers as a transcript
`Z : Fin q → P.Ω → σ`, and finally outputs an estimate `X̂ = f ∘ (tuple Z)`
computed from the transcript alone. The argument is four steps.

1. **Fano** (`fano_uniform`): a correct-with-probability-`1 - e` estimate of a
   uniform parameter must carry information, namely
   `1 - (I(X ; X̂) + log 2) / log |α| ≤ Pr[X̂ ≠ X]`.
2. **Data processing** (`I_comp_le`): the estimate is a function of the
   transcript, so `I(X ; X̂) ≤ I(X ; Z₁ … Z_q)`. This is where the
   "the algorithm knows nothing beyond what it asked" assumption is used, and it
   is the only place the map `f` appears.
3. **Chain rule** (`I_tuple_chain`): the transcript's information splits exactly
   into per-round contributions, `I(X ; Z₁ … Z_q) = Σᵢ I(X ; Zᵢ | Z_{<i})`.
4. **The per-step bound**: whatever the query model is, it is assumed to supply a
   constant `B` with `I(X ; Zᵢ | Z_{<i}) ≤ B` for every round — a single query
   answer reveals at most `B` nats about `X`, even conditioned on the history.
   Summing gives `I(X ; Z₁ … Z_q) ≤ q · B` (`I_tuple_le_of_step_bound`).

Chaining them and clearing the denominator yields
`(1 - e) · log |α| - log 2 ≤ q · B`, i.e. `q = Ω(log |α| / B)` queries are needed
to identify one of `|α|` equally likely alternatives with constant success
probability.

The statement is deliberately abstract: `σ` is an arbitrary finite answer
alphabet and `B` an arbitrary real. A concrete adaptive query model instantiates
`query_lower_bound` by exhibiting its transcript variables and proving the single
per-step hypothesis `hB`; no further information theory is needed downstream.

## Main results

* `Arlib.InformationTheory.I_tuple_le_of_step_bound` — chain rule plus a uniform
  per-round bound gives `I(X ; Z₁ … Z_q) ≤ q · B`.
* `Arlib.InformationTheory.query_lower_bound` — the lower bound itself.

/-- **Abstract adaptive query lower bound.** If a hidden parameter `X` is uniform on
`α`, an algorithm's estimate `X̂` is a function of its `q`-query transcript, each
query reveals at most `B` nats about `X` given the earlier ones, and the estimate is
wrong with probability at most `e`, then `q · B` is at least `(1 − e)·log |α| − log 2`.

Reading it as a lower bound on `q`: identifying one of `|α|` equally likely
alternatives with constant success probability costs `Ω(log |α| / B)` queries. -/
