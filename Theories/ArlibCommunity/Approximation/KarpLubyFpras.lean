# Karp–Luby driven by *randomized* size estimates

`Arlib.Approximation.KarpLubyApprox` closes the sampler half of the Gore et al.
strengthening: `isFPRAS_unionFpausAlg` builds an FPRAS for `|⋃_j A j|` out of
per-disjunct `IsFPAUS` samplers **plus deterministic `(1 ± ε/28)` size
estimates**.  This module removes the second hypothesis: the size estimates are
supplied by genuine per-disjunct `IsFPRAS` algorithms.

## Why this is not a substitution

An `IsFPAUS` guarantee is a statement about the law of a *single* run, so it
composes with the trial unconditionally (`optHitTestPMF_relErr`).  An `IsFPRAS`
guarantee holds only with probability `3/4`, so each `Ñ(A j)` is a *random real*
and the accuracy of the estimator becomes conditional on all `ℓ` of them being
good simultaneously.  Three things are needed, and they are the three sections
below.

## 1. Conditioning

`outProbR_bind_ge` is the chain rule `Pr[A ∧ B] ≥ Pr[B | A]·Pr[A]` for a
`PMF.bind`, with no independence assumed: the hypothesis is a lower bound on the
second stage that may inspect the *entire* first-stage outcome.
`one_sub_sub_le_outProbR_bind` is the additive shadow a failure budget is stated
in, `1 - γ - δ ≤ Pr[bind]`, obtained through
`UnionBound.one_sub_add_le_one_sub_mul_one_sub`.

This lemma is paper-independent.  `CQCount.TA.outProbR_bind_ge` is the same
statement, proved separately in the consumer repository; it should be replaced by
this one.

## 2. The heterogeneous product

`Amplification.repeatPMF` repeats **one** `PMF` `m` times, and the `ℓ` size
estimators have `ℓ` different laws, so it does not apply.  `prodPMF` is the
product of an indexed family `Fin m → PMF (β × ℕ)`, defined by the same recursion
— one draw, then `m` more, `Fin.cons`ed, costs added — so that the cost proof
(`prodPMF_cost_le`) and the support proof (`prodPMF_support_coord`) are the same
inductions.  Mathlib has no such construction: `PMF` on a pi type would need the
sample space finite, and `ℝ × ℕ` is not.

The **coordinate marginals are exact** (`outProb_prodPMF_coord`): the `i`-th
coordinate of the product is distributed as `μ i`.  This is what makes the union
bound over the `ℓ` coordinates an application of `UnionBound`'s
`one_sub_le_outProbR_biInter_of_le_div` rather than a new induction —
`one_sub_le_outProbR_prodPMF`: `ℓ` coordinates each good except with probability
`δ/ℓ` are simultaneously good except with probability `δ`.

## 3. Amplification, and what it costs

Each per-disjunct `IsFPRAS` has confidence `3/4`, and `ℓ` of them at `3/4` is
worthless.  `Amplification.IsFPRAS.amplify` (unconditional, since
`Concentration.majorityConcentration` discharges `MajorityConcentration`) raises
one of them to confidence `1 - δ` at `⌈8 log(1/δ)⌉₊` repetitions.  Here
`δ = sizeConf ℓ = 1/(8ℓ)`, so `sizeReps ℓ = ⌈8 log(8ℓ)⌉₊ = Θ(log ℓ)`
repetitions, and the union bound over the `ℓ` coordinates spends `1/8` in total.

**The running-time cost of the amplification is a factor `sizeReps ℓ` on the
constant and nothing on the degree** — `medianAlg_polytime` multiplies the
constant by the repetition count and leaves the exponent alone.  The `ℓ`
estimators are then run in sequence, a further factor `ℓ`; and running them at
tolerance `ε/28` costs `28^d` on the constant, `d` being the estimator's own
degree.  Since the `ℓ` estimators have `ℓ` different polynomial bounds, a single
pair `(c, d)` valid for all of them is extracted first
(`exists_uniform_polytime`, a `Finset.sup` of the degrees and a sum of the
constants).

## The budget

The overall confidence `3/4` is split evenly:

* `1/8` for the size estimates — `1/(8ℓ)` per disjunct, by the union bound;
* `1/8` for the Hoeffding deviation of the estimator itself, so the trial count
  is `sampleCount ℓ (ε/8) (1/8)` and not `KarpLubyApprox.unionApproxAlg`'s
  `sampleCount ℓ (ε/8) (1/4)`.

`1 - 1/8 - 1/8 = 3/4` exactly.  This is why the scheme is built from
`estimateApproxAlg` directly rather than from `unionApproxAlg`, whose confidence
is hard-wired at `1/4`.  The *accuracy* budget is untouched: `ε₀ = ε/28`,
`δ₀ = ε/16`, `ε₁ = ε/8` is `KarpLubyApprox.klBudget` verbatim.

## Main definitions

* `prodPMF` — the product of a heterogeneous family of randomized runs.
* `sizeConf`, `sizeReps` — the per-disjunct confidence `1/(8ℓ)` and the resulting
  repetition count.
* `unionFprasAlg` — the scheme: amplify and run the `ℓ` size estimators, then run
  the perturbed Karp–Luby estimator on their outputs.

## Main results

* `outProbR_bind_ge`, `one_sub_sub_le_outProbR_bind` — **(1)**.
* `prodPMF_cost_le`, `prodPMF_support_coord`, `outProb_prodPMF_coord`,
  `one_sub_le_outProbR_prodPMF` — **(2)**.
* `exists_uniform_polytime`, `sampleCount_le_of_log` — the two arithmetic
  ingredients of **(3)**.
* `isFPRAS_unionFprasAlg` — the headline: per-disjunct `IsFPRAS` counters plus
  per-disjunct `IsFPAUS` samplers give an FPRAS for the union.
* `isFPRAS_unionFpras_of_isUnion` — the same, for a `U` given only by
  `x ∈ U w ↔ ∃ i, x ∈ A w i`; this is the `estimate_isFPRAS` field of
  `CQCount.Union.UnionEstimator`.
* `isFPRAS_unionFprasAlg_satisfiable` — the three hypothesis bundles are
  simultaneously satisfiable, on an instance whose union is *nonempty*, so that
  neither the accuracy clause nor the uniformity clause holds vacuously.

No `sorry`, and no imported hypothesis bundle: `majorityConcentration` and
`hoeffdingBound` are both proved, so every result here has axioms
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

variable {β ζ : Type*}

/-- **The chain rule `Pr[A ∧ B] ≥ Pr[B | A] · Pr[A]`, for a `PMF.bind`.**

`μ` is the first stage, `f` the second, `S` an event of the first stage's output
and `T` an event of the whole.  If, *conditional on every first-stage outcome
that lands in `S`*, the second stage lands in `T` with probability at least `t`,
then the composite lands in `T` with probability at least `t · Pr_μ[S]`.

No independence is assumed: the conditioning *is* the `bind`, and the hypothesis
may inspect the entire first-stage outcome `p`, not merely the event `S`.  The
proof is `Sampling.outProb_bind` — `Pr_{μ.bind f}[T] = ∑' p, μ p · Pr_{f p}[T]` —
bounded below term by term in `ℝ≥0∞`, then pushed through `ENNReal.toReal`. -/

and support proofs are the same inductions.

vector `q.1` of estimates, run the perturbed Karp–Luby estimator of
`KarpLubyApprox` — index distribution `indexPMF q.1`, acceptance tests from the
samplers at bias `ε/16`, normalising constant `∑ j, q.1 j` — for
`sampleCount ℓ (ε/8) (1/8)` trials.  The costs of the two stages are added.

The trial count is at confidence `1/8`, not the `1/4` hard-wired into
`KarpLubyApprox.unionApproxAlg`, because the other `1/8` is spent on the size
estimates. -/

/-- **The main theorem: per-disjunct `IsFPRAS` counters and `IsFPAUS` samplers
give an FPRAS for the union.**

This is `KarpLubyApprox.isFPRAS_unionFpausAlg` with its remaining deterministic
hypothesis removed: the size estimates are no longer `(1 ± ε/28)` oracles but the
outputs of genuine approximate counters, whose guarantee holds only with
probability `3/4` and therefore has to be amplified and union-bounded.

The confidence budget is `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`; the accuracy budget is
`KarpLubyApprox.klBudget`'s `ε₀ = ε/28`, `δ₀ = ε/16`, `ε₁ = ε/8`, untouched.
Unconditional: `majorityConcentration` and `hoeffdingBound` are both proved. -/

/-! ## The hypotheses are satisfiable

`isFPRAS_unionFprasAlg` takes three hypothesis bundles, and a theorem whose
hypotheses cannot all hold proves nothing.  Here is a witness that they can, on a
**nondegenerate** instance — one whose union is not empty, so that neither the
accuracy clause nor the uniformity clause is discharged vacuously. -/

/-- **A witness for `isFPRAS_unionFprasAlg`.**

One disjunct, the singleton `{0} ⊆ ℕ`; the counter is the deterministic `1`, the
sampler the deterministic `some 0`.  Both are legitimate: the counter is exactly
right, and a point mass on the unique solution *is* the uniform distribution, so
it sits in the window `[(1-δ)/1, (1+δ)/1]` for every `δ`.

The union is `{0}`, of size `1 ≠ 0`, so the `uniform` clause of the `IsFPAUS` is
genuinely invoked and the accuracy window `|y - 1| ≤ ε` is a real constraint.
Every hypothesis of the main theorem is therefore simultaneously satisfiable, on
an instance where each of them has content. -/
