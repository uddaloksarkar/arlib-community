# Exactly uniform sampling from a self-reducible counting problem

A counting problem is *self-reducible* when every partial object `t` refines
into finitely many children whose solution sets **partition** the solution set
of `t`, and when after a fixed number `depth` of refinements the solution set is
a singleton.  Given a *deterministic* estimator `Ñ` of the solution counts, the
classical Jerrum–Valiant–Vazirani sampler walks down the refinement tree,
choosing a child with probability proportional to `Ñ`, and then accepts the
resulting complete object with probability `1 / (2 φ Ñ(root))`, where `φ` is the
running product of the probabilities used along the way.

This file gives that sampler, abstractly, and proves the two facts that make it
work.  Nothing here mentions trees, automata or words.

## Main results

* `SelfReducible.prod_card_ratio_chainFrom` — **the telescoping lemma**.  For a
  fixed solution `x` there is a unique chain `t₀ ↪ t₁ ↪ … ↪ t_depth` of partial
  objects containing `x`, and the true conditional probabilities
  `p_j = |U t_j| / |U t_{j-1}|` multiply to `1 / |U t₀|`.  This is purely
  combinatorial: it is a statement about nested partitions ending in a
  singleton, with no algorithm and no randomness in sight.
* `SelfReducible.phi_ge`, `SelfReducible.phi_le` — the two-sided bound
  `(Rᵈ)⁻¹ / |U root| ≤ φ ≤ Rᵈ / |U root|` with `R = (1+η)/(1−η)` and
  `d = depth`, obtained by combining the telescoping lemma with the estimator's
  relative error `η`.
* `SelfReducible.outcome_apply_some_eq` — **exact uniformity**: for every
  solution `x`, the sampler returns `x` with probability exactly
  `1 / (2 Ñ(root))`, which does not depend on `x`.
* `SelfReducible.outProbR_sample_none_le` — `Pr[FAIL] ≤ 3/4`.
* `SelfReducible.outProbR_sample_not_none` — `Pr[¬FAIL] = |U root| / (2 Ñ(root))`.
* `SelfReducible.conditional_uniform` — conditioned on not failing, the output
  is uniform on `U root`.

Two supporting results are of independent interest:
`SelfReducible.chainFrom_unique` (the chain of a solution is the *only* sequence
of refinements containing it) and `SelfReducible.walk_support_eq` (every run of
the walk follows such a chain, so the running product is a function of the
endpoint and the acceptance step is well defined).

## Two design decisions forced by the source

**The estimator is a deterministic function, not a random variable.**  The
paper's proof of the sampling lemma says "assuming the estimator *always*
returns an estimate with at most `(1 ± ε₁)` relative error".  That word is
load-bearing.  With a merely high-probability estimate the induced law is a
mixture over the estimator's randomness, the telescoping argument computes the
wrong thing, and the *exact* uniformity claim is false.  Worse, the estimate
must be the **same value** on repeated queries to the same partial object, or
the running product `φ` is not even a well-defined function of the run.  So
`Estimator` below is a plain function `τ → ℝ` carrying a *universally
quantified* error bound; it is never a `PMF`.

**The acceptance probability must be shown to be `≤ 1`.**  The source checks
only that `1 / (2 φ Ñ(root)) ≥ 1/4`, which is what bounds the failure
probability; it never checks that this quantity is at most `1`, and at the
paper's own standing hypotheses it can exceed `1`.  A number greater than `1` is
not a probability, and if the implementation clamps it then different solutions
are clamped by different amounts and *uniformity itself fails*.  The hypothesis
that repairs this is

`hacc : ((1 + η) / (1 - η)) ^ depth ≤ 2 * (1 - η)`

which is exactly what forces `φ · Ñ(root) ≥ 1/2`.  It is stated explicitly on
every theorem that needs it.  Note that it also implies `η ≤ 1/2` and, since
`(1-η)(1+η) ≤ 1`, it implies the bound `φ · Ñ(root) ≤ 2` needed for
`Pr[FAIL] ≤ 3/4`; so one honest hypothesis covers both sides.

Definitionally `accProb` takes a `min 1 (…)`, so that the sampler is a total
function and `PMF.bernoulli` applies; `accProb_eq` shows that
under `hacc` the clamp never fires, i.e. the formalized algorithm *is* the
paper's algorithm.

## Modelling of the algorithm

Randomized algorithms are modelled as in `Arlib.Approximation.Counting`: a
`PMF (β × ℕ)` recording the joint law of the output and a cost, read through
`outProb` / `outProbR`.  `SelfReducible.sample` is the law of one run of the
sampler; its output is an `Option Ω`, with `none` meaning `FAIL`, and its cost
is the number `depth` of refinement steps.

`τ` is the type of *partial objects* and `Ω` the type of *solutions*.  Each
partial object `t` has a finite set `ext t` of children and a finite solution

along a refinement step, and a rank-zero object has exactly one solution.

Mathlib's `PMF.bernoulli` takes its parameter in `ℝ≥0`, but the acceptance
probability below is built out of `ENNReal.ofReal` and a `min`, so it naturally
lives in `ℝ≥0∞`; restating the coin there keeps every downstream computation free

The outer `min 1` is a definitional device making this a legal probability

never fires.  The clamp cannot simply be dropped: the source never verifies that
`1 / (2 φ Ñ(root)) ≤ 1`, and where it fails the quantity is not a
probability. -/
