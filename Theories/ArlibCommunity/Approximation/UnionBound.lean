# Failure-budget bookkeeping: union bounds, margin products, staged inductions

A randomized algorithm assembled out of several randomized parts fails when *any*
part fails, and the arithmetic of that composition is the part of a paper's
analysis that is most often waved at.  This module is the bookkeeping layer: it
proves, once, the four facts that such an analysis consumes, in the `outProbR`
vocabulary of `Arlib.Approximation.Counting`.

## What is here

1. **The union bound over a `Finset`** (`outProb_biUnion_le`, `outProbR_biUnion_le`)
   and its conjunctive shadow (`one_sub_sum_le_outProbR_biInter`):
   `Pr[⋂_{i ∈ s} E i] ≥ 1 - ∑_{i ∈ s} δ i` whenever `Pr[¬E i] ≤ δ i`.  The
   disjunctive form `Pr[⋃_{i ∈ s} ¬E i] ≤ ∑ δ i` is stated too
   (`outProbR_biUnion_compl_le`), because it is usually the more usable one: it
   chains with further union bounds without any complementation.
2. **The product of margins** (`one_sub_add_le_one_sub_mul_one_sub`,
   `one_sub_sum_le_prod_one_sub`): `(1-a)(1-b) ≥ 1-a-b`, and
   `∏ (1 - a i) ≥ 1 - ∑ a i` for `a i ∈ [0,1]`.  This is the elementary
   inequality behind every "and the induction closes" step.
3. **The geometric staged invariant** (`one_sub_geom_le_of_geom_step`,
   `one_sub_rpow_le_of_geom_step`): the exact shape of the induction in
   `theo:fpras-bta`.
4. **Budget composition** (`sum_div_card`, `one_sub_le_outProbR_biInter_of_le_div`):
   `k` sources of failure at budget `δ/k` each buy an overall `1 - δ`; `k`
   sources at budget `δ` each buy only `1 - kδ`.

## What Mathlib already had, and is reused rather than reproved

* `MeasureTheory.measure_biUnion_finset_le` — finite subadditivity for anything
  in `OuterMeasureClass`, which `PMF.toOuterMeasure` is.  `outProb_biUnion_le` is
  a two-line transport of it through `Prod.fst`, not a new proof.
* `one_add_mul_le_pow` — Bernoulli, `1 + n·a ≤ (1+a)^n` for `-2 ≤ a`.  This is
  the *constant-budget* case `(1-a)^k ≥ 1 - k·a` of item 2 above and is quoted
  as such in `one_sub_nsmul_le_one_sub_pow`.
* `Finset.prod_one_sub_ordered` is the nearest thing Mathlib has to
  `one_sub_sum_le_prod_one_sub`, but it is an *identity* with a leftover
  `∑ i, a i * ∏_{j<i} (1 - a j)`, not the inequality; the variable-budget
  inequality is not in Mathlib and is proved here.
* `ENNReal.toReal_sum`, `ENNReal.sum_ne_top` — the `ℝ≥0∞ → ℝ` transport.

## The ACJR instance

Throughout, [ACJR21] is Marcelo Arenas, Luis Alberto Croquevielle, Rajesh
Jayaram, Cristian Riveros, *#NFA Admits an FPRAS: Efficient Enumeration,
Counting, and Uniform Generation for Logspace Classes*, J. ACM 68(6), art. 48
(2021), arXiv:1906.09226, together with its conjunctive-query companion *When Is
Approximate Counting for Conjunctive Queries Tractable?*, STOC 2021,
arXiv:2005.10029.  The statements quoted below are cited by the labels they
carry in the authors' manuscript (`theo:fpras-bta`, `lem:estimatepart`,
`prop:prop1`, …); that manuscript is a private multi-file source not distributed
with this library, so no line numbers are given and the labels are the locator.

`theo:fpras-bta` carries the invariant
`Pr[⋀_{j ≤ i}(ℰ¹_j ∧ ℰ²_j)] ≥ 1 - 2^{-γ+2i}`, closed by
`(1 - 2^{-γ+1})·(1 - 2^{-γ+2(i-1)}) ≥ 1 - 2^{-γ+2i}`.  Two observations, both
formalized below.

* **The closing inequality is true**, for every real `γ` and every `i ≥ 1`, with
  one hypothesis the paper does not state: `γ ≥ 1`.  It is needed because the
  step multiplies the induction hypothesis by `1 - 2^{-γ+1}`, and multiplying an
  inequality by a *negative* number reverses it.  Everything else is
  unconditional.  Written in terms of `x = 2^{-γ}` — as
  `one_sub_geom_le_of_geom_step` is — the hypothesis reads `2x ≤ 1` and the
  invariant reads `1 - 4^{i} x`, with no `rpow` anywhere.
* **The bound is vacuous unless `γ > 2i`.**  With `γ = log₂(1/δ) + 2n` and
  `i ≤ n` that is `log₂(1/δ) > 0`, i.e. `δ < 1` — always available.  At the top
  level `i = n` the invariant evaluates to exactly `1 - δ`
  (`two_rpow_neg_failureExponent_add`).

`failureExponent` and the lemmas around it also settle the conflation in the
paper's `FAIL` bound: with `γ = log₂(1/δ) + 2n` one has `2^{-γ} = δ/4^n`, which is
*strictly smaller* than `δ` for `n ≥ 1` (`two_rpow_neg_failureExponent_lt`), so reading
the `FAIL` bound `2^{-γ}` as `δ` is a conservative misstatement, not an unsound
one.  What is unsound is the total: three budgets each spent in full sum to
`2δ + δ/4^n`, which is `< 3δ` but emphatically not `δ`
(`three_budgets_sum`, `three_budgets_sum_lt`).  Running each source at `δ/3`
is what recovers the advertised `1 - δ` (`sum_div_card`).

/-! ## The product of margins -/

/-- **The two-factor product of margins.**  `(1-a)(1-b) ≥ 1 - a - b`: losing `a`
and then losing `b` costs at most `a + b`.

This is the inequality every "and so the induction closes" step is really using,
including the closing step of [ACJR21, `theo:fpras-bta`]. -/
theorem one_sub_add_le_one_sub_mul_one_sub {a b : ℝ} (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) :

  nlinarith [mul_nonneg ha hb]

/-- **The product of margins over a `Finset`.**  `∏ (1 - a i) ≥ 1 - ∑ a i` for
budgets `a i ∈ [0,1]`.

Both hypotheses are needed.  Without `0 ≤ a i` the sum can be made small while a
factor is huge; without `a i ≤ 1` the statement is false — three budgets equal to
`4` give `1 - ∑ = -11` on the left and `(-3)^3 = -27` on the right.

Mathlib has `Finset.prod_one_sub_ordered`, an exact expansion of the same
product, but not this inequality. -/

of at least `1 - k·a`.

This is Mathlib's Bernoulli inequality `one_add_mul_le_pow` at `-a`, recorded
here only so that callers writing failure budgets do not have to spot the
substitution.  The hypothesis `a ≤ 2` is Bernoulli's `-2 ≤ -a`, and is far
weaker than the `a ≤ 1` that `one_sub_sum_le_prod_one_sub` needs. -/

some `F i`, `i` ranging over a `Finset`, is at most the sum of the individual

`∑ δ i`.

This and `one_sub_sum_le_outProbR_biInter` are the same fact; this one is
usually the easier to chain, because it composes with further union bounds
without any complementation. -/

usually phrased ("except with probability `δ`"); see

/-! ## The geometric staged invariant

The shape of the induction in [ACJR21, `theo:fpras-bta`], stated in terms of
`x = 2^{-γ}` so that no `rpow` appears: the invariant `1 - 2^{-γ+2i}` becomes
`1 - 4^i · x` and the per-stage margin `1 - 2^{-γ+1}` becomes `1 - 2x`. -/

/-- **The closing step of the paper's induction, as pure arithmetic.**

`(1 - 2x)·(1 - 4^{k+1} x) ≥ 1 - 4^{k+2} x` for `0 ≤ x`.  The slack is
`x·(3·4^{k+1} - 2 + 2·4^{k+1} x)`, which is positive because `4^{k+1} ≥ 4`; this
is where the induction's `i ≥ 1` is used, and it is the *only* place it is used.

Note that no upper bound on `x` — hence no hypothesis on `γ` — is needed here.
The hypothesis `2x ≤ 1` enters one level up, in
`one_sub_geom_le_of_geom_step`, and for a different reason. -/

/-- **The staged geometric invariant.**

If a sequence of success probabilities starts at `q 0 ≥ 1 - 4x` and each step
retains at least a `(1 - 2x)` fraction of the previous one, then
`q k ≥ 1 - 4^{k+1} · x` for every `k`.

The hypothesis `2 * x ≤ 1` is the one the paper leaves implicit: the step
multiplies the induction hypothesis by `1 - 2x`, and that is only monotone when
`1 - 2x ≥ 0`.  In the paper's variables `x = 2^{-γ}`, so it says `γ ≥ 1`.

Indices are shifted by one relative to [ACJR21, `theo:fpras-bta`], whose `i` runs over
`[n]`: `q k` is the paper's `p_{k+1}` and the invariant `1 - 4^{k+1} x` is the
paper's `1 - 2^{-γ + 2i}` at `i = k + 1`. -/

/-- **`1 ≤ γ`**, the hypothesis `one_sub_rpow_le_of_geom_step` needs, holds for
the paper's `γ` whenever `δ ≤ 1` and `n ≥ 1` — in particular for the paper's own
standing `δ ∈ (0,1/2)`.  So the missing hypothesis is free, but it is missing. -/

/-! ## The failure accounting of `theo:fpras-bta`

The development notes record three budgets, each spent in full: the induction
invariant of [ACJR21, `theo:fpras-bta`], which is exactly `δ`; its `FAIL` bound,
which is `2^{-γ}`; and [ACJR21, `lem:estimatepart`]'s, which is again `δ`.  These
are added here — the paper never adds them — and the sum is what the algorithm
actually delivers. -/

/-- **The exact total.**  The three budgets of `theo:fpras-bta` sum to
`2δ + δ/4^n`. -/
theorem three_budgets_sum {δ : ℝ} (hδ : 0 < δ) (n : ℕ) :
    δ + (2 : ℝ) ^ (-failureExponent δ n) + δ = 2 * δ + δ / 4 ^ n := by
  rw [two_rpow_neg_failureExponent hδ n]; ring

/-- **`1 - 3δ`, and in fact slightly better.**  The development notes' "at best
`1 - 3δ`" is right as an upper bound on the loss, and is not tight: the true
total is `2δ + δ/4^n`, strictly below `3δ` for `n ≥ 1`.  What it is emphatically
not is `δ`. -/

/-- **The repair.**  Three sources of failure, each run at `δ/3`, total `δ`.
This is `sum_div_card` at `s = Finset.range 3`, and is what `theo:fpras-bta`
would have to do to advertise `1 - δ` honestly. -/
