# ArlibCommunity.Approximation.LewisWeights

**Cohen–Peng ℓ₁ row sampling by Lewis weights — proved, not assumed.**

The `Coresets/` area takes the ℓ¹ subspace-embedding guarantee (Lewis-weight row
sampling) as an *explicit hypothesis*: it develops what one may do with such a
reduction once one has it.  This area supplies the reduction itself, following
[CP15] — Michael B. Cohen, Richard Peng, *ℓ_p Row Sampling by Lewis Weights*,
STOC 2015, pp. 183–192 (arXiv:1412.0588) — specialised to `p = 1`, with its
elementary concentration proof (their Section 6 / Appendix reduction).  Its
statements are cited below by the labels they carry in the paper; that source is
not distributed with this library.

The end goal is to inhabit a *size-carrying* sparsification guarantee: a
randomised procedure that, from a weighted point set of `N` points with features
in `ℝ^d`, returns a reweighted subset of `O(d log d · δ⁻² · log(1/η))` of them
which is a `(1 ± δ)` subspace embedding, simultaneously for every query, with
failure probability at most `η`.

## Roadmap (staged; each stage lands green + axiom-clean before the next)

| Module | Content | Paper | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Rademacher` | Uniform sign averages `avg`, the sub-Gaussian MGF bound `avg_exp_le`. | §6 | ✅ |
| `Khintchine` | `avg_pow_le`: `𝔼_σ (∑ σᵢ xᵢ)^{2k} ≤ (2ek ∑xᵢ²)^k`. | Lemma "Khintchine" | ✅ |
| `LinAlg` | Rows `a_i`, Gram `A^T W^{-1} A`, quadratic form, PosDef, the Lewis-weight defining equation `a_iᵀM⁻¹a_i = w̄_i²` (`IsLewis`), and the moment identity `sum_sq_lev`. | Def. 2.2, §6 | ✅ |
| `Concentration` | Bilinear symmetry, the per-row energy bound, and the **finite** `momBound` `avg_sum_row_pow_le`. The infinite sup `max_{‖Ax‖₁=1}` is deliberately bypassed. | Lemmas 6.2–6.4 | ✅ |
| `Probability` | The uniform Rademacher `FinProb` (`radProb`), `Ex = avg`, Markov, and the moment-method tail `avg_pow_tail`. | §5 | ✅ |
| `HighProb` | `finiteProcess_tail` / `momBound_highProb`: the finite `momBound` as a high-probability bound. | §5–6 | ✅ |
| `Existence` | Existence of ℓ₁ Lewis weights via a Banach fixed point (`exists_isLewis`). | §4 | ✅ |
| `Trace` | The trace identity `∑ᵢ w̄ᵢ = d` (`sum_lewis_eq_card`). | §6 | ✅ |
| `Sensitivity` | The ℓ₁ sensitivity bound `\|aᵢ·y\| ≤ w̄ᵢ ‖Ay‖₁` (`abs_dot_le_lewis_L1`). | §6 | ✅ |

**Route B — a genuine embedding, proved from scratch (suboptimal size).**  The
importance sampler (`Sampler`), the bounded-independent-sum relative Chernoff
bound (`Bernstein`), the per-query concentration (`SampleConc`), the Euclidean and
Lewis-metric nets (`Net`, `MNet`) and the metric geometry of the two functionals
(`EmbedAux`) assemble in `Embed` to `lewis_importance_embeds`: for spanning
nonzero rows, importance sampling by Lewis weights produces, off an explicit small
failure event, a genuine `(1 ± δ)` ℓ₁ subspace embedding **for every query
simultaneously**.  This discharges the *accuracy* content of Theorem 1.1 with no
axiom; the size it certifies is polynomial but not optimal (`O(d² log d · δ⁻²)`,
the net's `log|net| = Θ(d log d)` costing one extra factor of `d`).

| Module | Content | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Net` / `MNet` | ε-nets: Euclidean (`exists_net_unit_ball`) and Lewis-metric via `M^{1/2}` (`exists_Mnet`). | ✅ |
| `Sampler` | The m-fold Lewis importance sampler and per-query unbiasedness (`estimator_unbiased`). | ✅ |
| `Bernstein` | Relative multiplicative Chernoff for a bounded fully-independent sum (`chernoff_relative`), MGF route. | ✅ |
| `SampleConc` | Per-query concentration `Pr[\|Ê(y)−‖Ay‖₁\| ≥ δ‖Ay‖₁] ≤ 2e^{−δ²m/4d}` (`sampledWPS_conc`). | ✅ |
| `EmbedAux` | The `g/f` upper/lower/Lipschitz bounds in the Lewis metric. | ✅ |
| `Embed` | **`lewis_importance_embeds`** — the all-query `(1±δ)` embedding. | ✅ |

**Route A — the optimal `O(d log d)` bound (in progress).**  The elementary
moment method on the *supremum*: rather than a net + union bound, bound
`𝔼_σ[(sup_{‖Ax‖₁≤1} σᵀAx)^{2k}]` in one shot via the **sup-bridge** `lewlinf`
(`SupBridge`, on the ℓ₁/ℓ∞ duality of `Duality` and the projection identity of
`Projection`), composed with the already-green finite `momBound`
(`avg_sum_row_pow_le`).  This removes the net entirely — and with it the extra
factor of `d` — reaching the optimal-in-`d` count `O(d · log(n/δ) · ε⁻²)` with **no
matrix Chernoff**.  The `momentreduct` sampling reduction — the classical
symmetrization + Ledoux–Talagrand contraction connecting the sampler's error to a
sign process — is proved for the **sampling moment** (`MomentReduct`,
`Symmetrize`, `Contraction`); the only remaining gap to a fully-optimal *uniform*
importance-sampling embedding is the *supremum-level* contraction (uniform over all
queries), which needs suprema-of-stochastic-processes infrastructure absent from
Mathlib, and (for `log n → log d`) Talagrand's iterative row-halving.  See
`docs/dev/LewisWeights-ROUTE_A_PLAN.md`.

| Module | Content | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Projection` | The `w̄⁻¹`-orthogonal projection `Π A = A` and `(Πᵀσ)ᵢ = ` per-row process. | ✅ |
| `Duality` | ℓ₁/ℓ∞ duality and its even-power form (`dot_pow_le_sum_abs_pow`). | ✅ |
| `SupBridge` | `lewlinf`: `(sup_x σᵀAx)^{2k} ≤ ∑ᵢ(Πᵀσ)ᵢ^{2k}`, and the process moment bound `avg_process_pow_le`. | ✅ |
| `RouteA` | **`process_uniform_tail`** — the net-free uniform tail `Pr[∃x, ‖Ax‖₁≤1, \|σᵀAx\|≥c] ≤ n(2ekU)^k/c^{2k}`: the optimal-in-`d` concentration core. | ✅ |
| `Contraction` | **`avg_abs_sign_pow_eq`** — the exact per-query (L4) sign-flip contraction stripping `\|·\|` from the sign process. | ✅ |
| `SymmSwap` | **`Ex_prodFinProb_swapPair`** — the measure-preserving per-coordinate swap on the product sampler space (the crux of symmetrization). | ✅ |
| `Symmetrize` | **`sampled_central_moment_le_symm`** (L5) — `𝔼_ω[(Ê(y)−‖Ay‖₁)^{2k}] ≤ 2^{2k}·𝔼_{σ,ω}[(∑ᵣσᵣsval(ωᵣ))^{2k}]`: symmetrization to the sign process. | ✅ |
| `MomentReduct` | **`sampled_moment_le_energy`** — Cohen–Peng's `lem:momentreduct`: the sampling moment reduced to the empirical energy `𝔼_ω[(2ek·∑ᵣsval(ωᵣ)²)^k]` (symmetrization ∘ Khintchine). | ✅ |
| *(uniform-optimal)* | the supremum-level contraction + `weakbound`/Talagrand halving for a fully-optimal *uniform* importance-sampling embedding. | ⬜ |

No `sorry` in any ✅ module.
