# `thm:samplemain`'s assembly, with the constants surviving it

`thm:samplemain` is the label the sampling theorem carries in [ACJR21]
(Arenas–Croquevielle–Jayaram–Riveros; the full reference, and the reason
statements of that work are cited by label rather than by page, are in
`Arlib/Approximation/Sampling.lean`).

`Approximation/Sampling.lean` turns a `PreprocessedSampler` into an `IsFPAUS`.
Its running-time clause is `IsFPAUS.polytime`, an `∃ c d`, and the two numbers
it quantifies away are *computed* in the proof: they are

    5 · (c · (c' + 4) ^ d)      and      max d' 1 · d + 1,

where `(c, d)` is the pinned form of `PreprocessedSampler.cost` and `(c', d')`
the pinned form of the `log_card_poly` side condition.  This module states them.

## Why this is not cosmetic

`Approximation/Pinned.lean` exists because `PolyBounded` and the two `polytime`
clauses are existentials that a zero-cost non-algorithm satisfies, so a
development that has actually computed an exponent has no way to say so.  The
`Pinned` module supplies the vocabulary and the *transfer* theorems
(`IsFPAUS.comp_bijection_pinned_on`), but it does not supply the **producer**:
before this module, the only route from a `PreprocessedSampler` to an `IsFPAUS`
opened the existential at `PreprocessedSampler.cost` and again at
`IsFPAUS.polytime`, so no caller of `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS` could feed
`comp_bijection_pinned_on`.  A caller therefore had to prove the accuracy of one
sampler and the running time of another, and had no lemma with which to notice.

`PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS_pinned` closes that: it returns the **conjunction**
of `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS`'s own conclusion — proved by calling it, so the
two cannot disagree — with an `IsFPAUS.PinnedTime` about the *same* `retrySampler`
term.

## What is **not** repaired

Nothing here makes an upper bound into evidence that work was done.
`IsFPAUS.pinnedTime_of_cost_zero` still applies, and worse:
`retrySampler_not_charges_of_bad_free` shows that `IsFPAUS.Charges` is
**refutable** for `retrySampler g good bad` whenever the preprocessing-failure
branch `bad` is the zero-cost constant `FAIL` — which is a legal `bad`, since
`PreprocessedSampler` constrains that branch only through `empty` and `cost`.
So on the cheapest legal instantiation of `thm:samplemain`'s own hypotheses the
assembled sampler provably has cost-`0` runs, and the sandwich of
`Approximation/Pinned.lean` cannot be closed at this level at all.  What *can*
close it is a hop that adds a positive cost, which is why
`IsFPAUS.Charges.map_add_of_cost_pos` is here beside it: after a reduction that
charges its own construction, `Charges` holds for the composite even though it
fails for the sampler being composed.

## Main results

* `PinnedAttemptCost` — `PreprocessedSampler.cost` with `∃ c d` removed, and
  `preprocessedSampler_cost_iff` saying the field is exactly its existential
  closure.
* `retrySampler_pinnedTime` — the assembly's running time, at
  `retryAssemblyConst`/`retryAssemblyExp`.
* `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS_pinned` — the conjunction.
* `PinnedBounded.comp` — composing a pinned bound with an outer polynomial
  without a `max` appearing, the pinned companion of the `PolyBounded`
  transitivity every size-blow-up chain uses.
* `IsFPAUS.Charges.map_add_of_cost_pos` — `Charges` from the reduction's own
  charge alone, with nothing assumed about the algorithm being composed.
* `retrySampler_not_charges_of_bad_free` — and the refutation that makes the
  previous lemma necessary rather than convenient.

/-- **`PreprocessedSampler.cost` with the `∃ c d` removed.**

Both branches of one attempt, at the preprocessing tolerance `δ₀`, are bounded by
`c · (‖w‖ + ⌈log(1/δ₀)⌉ + 1) ^ d`.  Stated as a predicate rather than as a field
so that it attaches to an existing `PreprocessedSampler` without changing that
structure's type — the same discipline `IsFPAUS.PinnedTime` follows. -/

    (∀ p ∈ (bad w δ₀).support, p.2 ≤ c * (size w + ⌈Real.log (1/δ₀)⌉₊ + 1) ^ d)

/-- **What the structure gives back**: some pair, and no more.

`PreprocessedSampler.cost` is the existential closure of `PinnedAttemptCost` on
the nose, so this is the exact sense in which a caller holding only a
`PreprocessedSampler` holds no number.  The mirror of
`IsFPAUS.exists_pinnedTime`, one rung further up the chain, and the reason the
number has to be supplied as a *hypothesis* below rather than recovered. -/

/-! ## The constants the assembly reaches -/

/-- **The constant of `retrySampler`**: `5 · c · (c' + 4) ^ d`.

`5` is the retry loop's `retryCount δ ≤ 5(‖w‖ + ⌈log(1/δ)⌉ + 1)`
(`retryCount_le`); `(c' + 4) ^ d` is the tolerance composition
`δ₀ = δ/(2(|g w| + 1))` seen through `ceil_log_preTol_le` and the pinned
`log_card` bound, raised to the attempt's own degree. -/
def retryAssemblyConst (c c' d : ℕ) : ℕ := 5 * (c * (c' + 4) ^ d)

/-- **The exponent of `retrySampler`**: `max d' 1 · d + 1`.

`max d' 1 · d` is the attempt's degree seen through the tolerance composition —
this is where the `log |g w|` bound's degree *multiplies* rather than adds — and
the `+ 1` is the retry loop's linear factor. -/
def retryAssemblyExp (d d' : ℕ) : ℕ := max d' 1 * d + 1

/-- **The running time of `thm:samplemain`'s assembled sampler, with both
constants written down.**

This is the `polytime` field of `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS`, verbatim, with the
two `obtain`s at its head replaced by hypotheses.  Nothing about the bound
changes; what changes is that the caller keeps the numbers.

The `log_card` hypothesis is the one `Sampling.lean`'s docstring flags as the
source's unstated one: the preprocessing runs at `δ₀ = δ/(2(|g w|+1))`, so its
own time is polynomial in `log(1/δ₀) = log(1/δ) + log|g w| + O(1)`, and nothing
forces `log |g w|` to be polynomial in `size w`. -/

The first component is `PreprocessedSampler.isFPAUS` itself — called, not
re-proved, so the accuracy conclusion here is *the same proposition* that
development already establishes — and the second is `retrySampler_pinnedTime`
about the same `retrySampler g good bad` term.

This is the lemma a caller needs in order to feed
`IsFPAUS.comp_bijection_pinned_on`: without it the sampler whose accuracy is
known and the sampler whose running time is known are related only by an
existential that has already been opened twice. -/

/-! ## Composing a pinned bound with an outer polynomial

A size blow-up that factors through an intermediate measure — "the reduction's
automaton is polynomial in the input, and the *preprocessed* automaton is
polynomial in that" — is the shape every multi-stage reduction produces.  The
`PolyBounded` version quantifies both pairs away; this one does not, and needs no
`max` because the outer degree is assumed positive, which it always is in
practice. -/

/-- **`PinnedBounded`, composed.**  If `f` is pinned at `(c', e')` and
`g w ≤ c·(f w + 1)^e`, then `g` is pinned at `(c·(c'+1)^e, e'·e)`.

The exponents **multiply**.  That is the whole content: a two-stage size blow-up
costs a product, not a sum, and any development that routes a running-time bound
through an intermediate instance pays it.  Unlike the `PolyBounded` version,
which has to write `max e' 1` because the intermediate degree is unknown, no
`max` appears — the multiplication is correct at `e' = 0` too, where it says a
bounded intermediate contributes nothing. -/

If `s w + 1 ≤ m·(s' w + 1)` then a bound in `s` becomes a bound in `s'` with the
factor absorbed as `c ↦ c·mᵉ`.  The exponent is untouched, which is the point: a
normalisation that only inflates the instance by a constant factor is free in the
degree, and stating that requires the pinned form — through `PolyBounded` the
degree is quantified away and there is nothing to compare.

`δ` is not rescaled anywhere, so the `⌈log(1/δ)⌉` term rides along; the counting
analogue would have to say the same of `⌈ε⁻¹⌉`. -/

wrong hypothesis whenever `B` is a `retrySampler` whose failure branch is free —
see `retrySampler_not_charges_of_bad_free` — and it is not needed: the composed

/-- **`IsFPAUS.Charges` is refutable for `thm:samplemain`'s assembly.**

`PreprocessedSampler` constrains the preprocessing-failure branch `bad` only
through `empty` and `cost`, so the zero-cost constant `FAIL` is a legal `bad` —
and it is the cheapest one, hence the one a satisfiability certificate will pick.
With it, the mixture's failure branch contributes the run `(FAIL, 0)` at every
instance and every tolerance, and `Charges` fails outright.

Note what this is *not*: it is not a statement about `good`, and not about any
particular `good`.  It says that the assembly's cost sandwich cannot be closed at
this level whatever the attempt costs, because the assembly is a mixture with a
free branch.  A caller wanting `Charges` must get it from a later hop that
charges unconditionally — `IsFPAUS.Charges.map_add_of_cost_pos`. -/
