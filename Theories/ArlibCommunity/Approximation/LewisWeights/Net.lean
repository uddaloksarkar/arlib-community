# ε-nets of the unit ball of `ι → ℝ` and the net ⇒ sup transfer

Two self-contained ingredients for a Route-B ℓ₁ subspace-embedding argument.

* `exists_net_unit_ball` : the sup-norm unit ball of a `d`-dimensional space
  `ι → ℝ` (`d = Fintype.card ι`) admits a finite `ε`-net contained in the ball
  whose cardinality is at most `(3 / ε)^d`, for `0 < ε ≤ 1`.  The net is the
  coordinatewise grid `{ k·ε : |k·ε| ≤ 1 }^d`, of size `(2⌊1/ε⌋+1)^d ≤ (3/ε)^d`.

* `abs_le_of_net` : if `f` is `L`-Lipschitz for the sup-norm and `|f s| ≤ B` on
  every point `s` of an `ε`-net of the unit ball, then `|f x| ≤ B + L·ε` for
  every `x` in the unit ball.  This upgrades a per-net-point bound to a uniform
  bound over the whole ball.

The two results are independent.  The metric throughout is the `Pi` sup-norm
`‖x‖ = maxᵢ |xᵢ|` on `ι → ℝ`.

/-! ### Net ⇒ sup transfer for a Lipschitz function -/

/-- **Net ⇒ sup.**  If `f` is `L`-Lipschitz for the sup-norm on `ι → ℝ`
(hypothesis `hf`, stated elementarily), and `|f s| ≤ B` on every point `s` of an
`ε`-net `S` of the unit ball (hypothesis `hnet` supplies, for each ball point, a
net point within `ε`), then `|f x| ≤ B + L·ε` for every `x` in the unit ball.

This is the transfer lemma that turns a bound checked on the finitely many net
points into a bound valid over the whole ball. -/

/-! ### A finite `ε`-net of the sup-norm unit ball -/

/-- **Covering-number bound.**  For `0 < ε ≤ 1`, the sup-norm unit ball of
`ι → ℝ` admits a finite `ε`-net `S` that is itself contained in the ball, of
cardinality at most `(3 / ε) ^ (Fintype.card ι)`.

Concretely `S` is the coordinatewise grid `{ k·ε : k ∈ ℤ, |k| ≤ ⌊1/ε⌋ }^ι`; the
one-dimensional net `{ k·ε : |k| ≤ ⌊1/ε⌋ }` of `[-1,1]` has `2⌊1/ε⌋+1 ≤ 3/ε`
points and `ε`-covers `[-1,1]`, so the product grid `ε`-covers the ball (sup
norm) with at most `(3/ε)^d` points. -/
