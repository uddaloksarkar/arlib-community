# Karp–Luby with approximate inputs: the Gore et al. strengthening

`Arlib.Approximation.KarpLuby` proves the union-of-sets estimator when the
per-set sizes are known **exactly** and the per-set samplers are **exactly
uniform**.  Neither hypothesis is available in the intended application, where
the per-disjunct counting problem is itself only approximable.  This module
redoes the analysis with

* size estimates `Ñ(A j) ∈ (1 ± ε₀)·|A j|` in place of `|A j|`, and
* samplers with `D j(x) ∈ [(1-δ₀)/|A j|, (1+δ₀)/|A j|]` in place of uniform ones,

keeping the membership tests exact.  That is the strengthening attributed to
"Gore et al." in a sibling repository (`CQCount/Union/Fpras.lean`), which is not
distributed with this library.  **The attribution could not be resolved to a
publication from anything in this repository**, so no reference is given here;
nothing below depends on it, since every statement is proved from scratch.

## 1. The perturbed acceptance probability, and the explicit `η`

The estimator draws `j` from a distribution `ι` meant to be proportional to the
*estimated* sizes, then runs a `{0,1}`-valued acceptance test `K j`.  Two things
move relative to the exact case, and they move by different amounts.

**The index weights are a ratio.**  `Ñ(A j) / Σ_{j'} Ñ(A j')` is a quotient of two
`(1±ε₀)` quantities.  Numerator and denominator each carry `ε₀` — the denominator
for free, since `MulError.relErr_sum` costs nothing — but the quotient carries

`weightTol ε₀ = 2ε₀/(1-ε₀)`,

by `MulError.relErr_div_same`.  It is **not** `ε₀`; `MulError.relErr_div_counterexample`
is a machine-checked refutation of the naive reading.  This is `indexWeight_relErr`,
and `indexPMF_relErr` transports it through the actual construction of `ι`.

**The sampler is biased**, contributing a further `(1 ± δ₀)` — and only `δ₀`,
independent of `ℓ` and of `|firstHits A j|`, because a shared window is inherited
by a sum at no cost (`sum_mem_relErr_of_almostUniform`).

The two windows *multiply* index by index and are only then summed, so the
composed tolerance is

**`η = klEta ε₀ δ₀ = 2ε₀/(1-ε₀) + δ₀ + (2ε₀/(1-ε₀))·δ₀`**,

with the cross term that `MulError.relErr_mul` shows is unavoidable.  The main
result of this section, `acceptProb_perturbed_of_estimates`, is that the perturbed
trial accepts with probability in `(1 ± η)·acceptProb A`.  `klEta_le` linearises
it to `η ≤ 3ε₀ + 2δ₀`, valid for `ε₀ ≤ 1/3`; every budget below goes through that
form and `klEta` is never expanded again.

`ℓ` does **not** appear in `η`.  Summation over the `ℓ` indices is free; the only
place `ℓ` enters is the sample count, exactly as in the exact case.

## 2. The estimator

`estimateApproxAlg Ntot μ h` runs the trial `μ` independently `h` times and
returns `Ntot` — the *estimated* total — times the empirical acceptance rate.
`estimateApproxAlg_accuracy` composes three windows:

* `(1 ± η)` on the acceptance probability (section 1);
* the Hoeffding deviation `ε₁/ℓ`, which `inv_card_le_acceptProb` converts into a
  relative `(1 ± ε₁)` — this is the only use of `ℓ`;
* `(1 ± ε₀)` on `Ntot`;

giving `(1 ± ε)` on `|⋃_j A j|` with probability `1 - δ` from
`sampleCount ℓ ε₁ δ = ⌈ℓ² log(2/δ)/(2ε₁²)⌉₊` trials.

### The hypotheses relating `ε₀`, `δ₀`, `ℓ` and `ε`

`estimateApproxAlg_accuracy` carries them explicitly, and they are **not**
consequences of the three tolerances merely being small:

* `ε₀ ≤ 1` and `ε₁ + η ≤ 1` — needed by `MulError.relErr_mul`;
* **`ε₀ + 2(ε₁ + η) ≤ ε`** — the budget, `MulError.compose_tol_le` applied to the
  product `Ntot · (empirical rate)`;
* `ε₀ ≤ 1/3` (inside `klEta_le`) — needed for `weightTol ε₀ ≤ 1`.

They are satisfiable: `klBudget` proves that `ε₀ = ε/28`, `δ₀ = ε/16`,
`ε₁ = ε/8` discharges all of them for every `ε ∈ (0,1)`, with the composed
tolerance coming out at `3ε/4`.  Nothing here is tight; what matters is that the
three tolerances must be fixed fractions *of the target `ε`*, and that `ε₀` pays
the factor `3` of `weightTol` before anything else happens.

There is **no** hypothesis relating the tolerances to `ℓ`.

## 3. The scheme, as an `IsFPRAS`

`unionApproxAlg ι K Ntot c` is the scheme; `isFPRAS_unionApproxAlg` is its FPRAS
guarantee, at the calibration above, unconditionally — `HoeffdingBound` is
discharged by `Arlib.Approximation.hoeffdingBound`, so printing the axioms of any
result here returns `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Two hypotheses of `isFPRAS_unionApproxAlg` differ in shape from the exact case
and both differences are forced:

* the index window is required only on instances with `0 < totalCard (A w)`.  On
  the empty family the true weights are all `0` and *no* probability distribution
  lies in a multiplicative window around them; the estimator is nevertheless exact
  there, because `(1 ± ε₀)·0 = {0}` pins `Ntot` to `0`;
* the per-trial cost `c` depends on `ε` as well as on the instance, because the
  sampler it runs does: an `IsFPAUS` at bias `ε/16` is polynomial in `log(16/ε)`.

`isFPRAS_unionFpausAlg` specialises this to a scheme whose acceptance tests are
built from genuine per-disjunct **`IsFPAUS` samplers** (`optHitTestPMF`), and whose
index distribution is built from per-set size estimates (`indexPMF`).

## 4. Alignment with `CQCount.Union.UnionEstimator`, and what is *not* done

The consumer's bundle (`CQCount/Union/Fpras.lean`, in a sibling repository not
distributed with this library) has six fields.  Field by field:

* `memCost`, `memCost_poly` — subsumed by the single per-trial cost bound `hc`,
  which charges one trial (index draw, sample draw, and the membership tests
  deciding `x ∈ firstHits`) as a whole.  This is the same accounting
  `KarpLuby.isFPRAS_unionAlg` uses.
* `isUnion` — `KarpLuby.unionAll_eq_of_isUnion`; consumed by
  `isFPRAS_unionApprox_of_isUnion`, which is stated for an abstract `U` given only
  `∀ w x, x ∈ U w ↔ ∃ i, x ∈ S w i`.
* `estimate` — `unionApproxAlg` / `unionFpausAlg`.
* `estimate_isFPRAS` — **not discharged.**  What is proved is
  `isFPRAS_unionFpausAlg`: the FPRAS follows from per-disjunct `IsFPAUS` samplers
  together with *deterministic* `(1 ± ε/28)` size estimates.  The remaining gap is
  exactly one thing, and it is the size estimates, not the samplers.

  The asymmetry is real and is worth stating precisely.  An `IsFPAUS` can be
  plugged in **directly**: its guarantee is a statement about the law of a single
  run, so it holds unconditionally and composes with the trial with no
  conditioning (`optHitTestPMF_relErr`).  An `IsFPRAS` cannot: its `(1 ± ε₀)`
  window holds only with probability `3/4`, so `Ñ(A j)` is a *random* real, and
  turning the hypothesis `hNapx` into a hypothesis about `ℓ` independent random
  estimates needs three further ingredients that are not built here —

  1. a product `PMF` of `ℓ` **heterogeneous** runs, i.e. an analogue of
     `Amplification.repeatPMF` indexed by `Fin ℓ` with a different `PMF` at each
     coordinate (`repeatPMF` repeats one `PMF`, so it does not apply);
  2. a union bound over the `ℓ` coordinates of that product, after amplifying each
     `A i` from confidence `3/4` to `1 - 1/(8ℓ)` with
     `Amplification.IsFPRAS.amplify`;
  3. a conditioning lemma `1 - γ - δ ≤ outProbR (ν.bind f) S` from
     `1 - γ ≤ outProbR ν G` and `1 - δ ≤ outProbR (f p) S` for `p` in `G`.

  None of these is deep, but none of them is repackaging either, and (1) in
  particular is a new construction with its own support and cost lemmas.  They are
  the honest remaining distance to `estimate_isFPRAS`.
* `sample`, `sample_isFPAUS` — **out of scope**.  The Karp–Luby / JVV rejection
  *sampler* for the union is a separate construction, not a corollary of anything
  here.

## Main definitions

* `hitTestPMF`, `optHitTestPMF` — the acceptance test, from an exact-support
  sampler and from an `Option`-valued (possibly failing) one.
* `perturbedTrialPMF`, `perturbedTrialAlg` — one perturbed Karp–Luby trial.
* `weightTol`, `klEta` — the index-weight tolerance `2ε₀/(1-ε₀)` and the composed
  tolerance `η`.
* `indexPMF` — the index distribution proportional to given size estimates.
* `estimateApproxAlg`, `unionApproxAlg`, `unionFpausAlg` — the estimator and the
  two schemes.

## Main results

* `outProbR_perturbedTrialAlg_one` — the acceptance probability of a perturbed
  trial, *exactly*, for arbitrary `ι` and `K`.
* `indexWeight_relErr`, `indexPMF_relErr` — the `2ε₀/(1-ε₀)` window on the index
  weights.
* `sum_mem_relErr_of_almostUniform`, `optHitTestPMF_relErr` — an almost-uniform
  sampler is `(1 ± δ)` on every sub-event; the `IsFPAUS` interface.
* `acceptProb_perturbed`, `acceptProb_perturbed_of_estimates` — **(1)**, with `η`
  explicit.
* `klEta_le`, `klBudget` — the linearised `η` and the satisfiability of the budget.
* `estimateApproxAlg_accuracy` — **(2)**.
* `isFPRAS_unionApproxAlg`, `isFPRAS_unionApprox_of_isUnion`,
  `isFPRAS_unionFpausAlg` — **(3)**, and **(4)** as far as it goes.

/-! ## The two tolerances, and the composed tolerance `η` -/

/-- **The index-weight tolerance.**  If every size estimate `Ñ(A j)` is a
`(1 ± ε₀)`-approximation of `|A j|`, the *normalised* weight
`Ñ(A j) / Σ_{j'} Ñ(A j')` is a `(1 ± 2ε₀/(1-ε₀))`-approximation of the true
weight `|A j| / Σ_{j'} |A j'|` — **not** a `(1 ± ε₀)`-approximation.

The quantity is a ratio of two `(1±ε₀)` quantities, so `MulError.relErr_div_same`
applies and `MulError.relErr_div_counterexample` shows the naive reading fails
outright.  Writing `ε₀` here would be an error of a factor two (and worse as
`ε₀ → 1`). -/

probability `(1 ± η(ε₀, δ₀)) · acceptProb A`, where

`η(ε₀, δ₀) = 2ε₀/(1-ε₀) + δ₀ + (2ε₀/(1-ε₀))·δ₀`.

The three summands are, in order: the index-weight perturbation (`weightTol`), the
sampler bias, and the cross term that `MulError.relErr_mul` shows is unavoidable
when two windows multiply. -/

variable {Ω : Type*} [DecidableEq Ω] {ℓ : ℕ}

/-- **The Karp–Luby estimator with an approximate normalising constant.**  Run the
trial `μ` independently `h` times and return `Ntot` times the empirical acceptance
rate, at the summed cost.

`Ntot` is the *estimated* total `Σ_j Ñ(A j)`, not the exact `Σ_j |A j|`; that
substitution is the second half of Gore et al.'s strengthening, and it is the only
difference from `KarpLuby.estimateAlg`. -/
noncomputable def estimateApproxAlg (Ntot : ℝ) (μ : PMF (ℝ × ℕ)) (h : ℕ) : PMF (ℝ × ℕ) :=
  (repeatPMF μ h).map fun q => (Ntot * ((∑ i, q.1 i) / (h : ℝ)), q.2)

/-- **(2) The estimator's error bound with approximate inputs.**

Suppose

* the trial `μ` is `{0,1}`-valued and accepts with probability within `(1 ± η)` of
  `acceptProb A` — the conclusion of `acceptProb_perturbed_of_estimates`, with
  `η = klEta ε₀ δ₀`;
* the normalising constant `Ntot` is within `(1 ± ε₀)` of `Σ_j |A j|` — which
  `MulError.relErr_sum` gives free from per-set `(1 ± ε₀)` estimates;
* the sampling deviation `ε₁` and the two biases fit the target `ε`:
  `ε₁ + η ≤ 1` and `ε₀ + 2(ε₁ + η) ≤ ε`.

Then `sampleCount ℓ ε₁ δ` trials produce a `(1 ± ε)`-approximation of `|⋃_j A j|`
with probability at least `1 - δ`.

**The budget hypotheses are explicit and are the whole content of the
composition.**  `ε₀ + 2(ε₁ + η) ≤ ε` is `MulError.compose_tol_le` applied to the
product `Ntot · (empirical rate)`; it is satisfiable — see
`unionApproxAlg_budget` — but it is a genuine constraint tying `ε₀`, `δ₀` and `ε`
together, not a consequence of each being small on its own.

The `ℓ` enters only through `sampleCount`, exactly as in the exact case: the
`1/ℓ` lower bound `inv_card_le_acceptProb` converts the additive Hoeffding
deviation `ε₁/ℓ` into the relative deviation `ε₁`. -/

* per-set size tolerance `ε₀ = ε/28`,

* Hoeffding relative deviation `ε₁ = ε/8`,

both hypotheses of `estimateApproxAlg_accuracy` hold for every `ε ∈ (0,1)`, with
slack: the composed tolerance is at most `3ε/4`.

The constants are not tight and are not meant to be; what matters is that the
constraint *is* a constraint — the three tolerances must be chosen as fixed
fractions of the *target* `ε`, and `ε₀` in particular pays the factor `3` of
`weightTol` (`klEta_le`) before anything else happens. -/

/-- **The Karp–Luby scheme with approximate inputs.**

On instance `w` at tolerance `ε`: draw indices from `ι w ε` (in the intended
reading, proportional to the *estimated* sizes), run the per-index acceptance
tests `K w ε`, repeat `sampleCount ℓ (ε/8) (1/4)` times and scale by the
*estimated* total `Ntot w ε`.

`ι`, `K` and `Ntot` are parameters rather than terms built from per-disjunct
schemes; see the module docstring for exactly what remains to be done to build
them from an `IsFPRAS`/`IsFPAUS` pair.

The per-trial cost `c` depends on `ε` as well as on the instance, because the
sampler it runs does: an `IsFPAUS` charged at bias `ε/16` takes time polynomial
in `log(16/ε)`. -/

Hypotheses, all at instance `w` and tolerance `ε ∈ (0,1)`:

* `hK0` — each acceptance test is `{0,1}`-valued;
* `hι` — on a nonempty family, the index distribution is within
  `(1 ± 2ε₀/(1-ε₀))` of the true weights at `ε₀ = ε/28`.  This is what per-set
  `(1 ± ε/28)` *size estimates* deliver, by `indexWeight_relErr`; note the
  tolerance is the ratio tolerance `weightTol (ε/28)`, **not** `ε/28`.  The
  restriction to `0 < totalCard (A w)` is not a convenience: on the empty family
  the true weights are all `0` and no probability distribution can be within a
  multiplicative window of them;
* `hK` — each acceptance test is within `(1 ± ε/16)` of the exact hit
  probability.  This is what a `(1 ± ε/16)`-almost-uniform sampler delivers, by
  `sampledHitProb_relErr` (or `optHitTestPMF_relErr` for an `IsFPAUS`);
* `hNtot` — the normalising constant is within `(1 ± ε/28)` of `Σ_j |A w j|`;
* `hc` — one trial costs polynomially many steps, in the instance size *and* in
  `ε⁻¹`.

`Arlib.Approximation.hoeffdingBound`, so nothing is imported and `#print axioms`

/-! ## The scheme driven by per-disjunct almost-uniform samplers

The sampler half of the Gore et al. bundle, closed: the per-disjunct `IsFPAUS`
is consumed *directly*, with no conditioning and no union bound, because its
guarantee is distributional and holds on every run.

The size estimates are still supplied as deterministic `(1 ± ε/28)` oracles.  See
the module docstring for exactly what stands between this and the bundle's
`estimate_isFPRAS`. -/

section FpausScheme

variable {Ω : Type*} [DecidableEq Ω] {ℓ : ℕ} [NeZero ℓ] {α : Type*}

/-- **The Karp–Luby scheme driven by per-disjunct almost-uniform samplers.**

Index weights come from the size estimates `Napx w ε` through `indexPMF`; the
acceptance tests come from the samplers `B j` run at bias `ε/16` through
`optHitTestPMF`; the normalising constant is `Σ_j Napx w ε j`. -/

/-- **The scheme driven by almost-uniform samplers is an FPRAS for the union.**

Inputs: deterministic per-set `(1 ± ε/28)` size estimates, per-disjunct
`IsFPAUS` samplers, and a per-trial cost bound.  The samplers are used at bias
`ε/16`, which is legitimate exactly because `IsFPAUS.uniform` is a statement about
the law of a single run.

Note that no nonemptiness hypothesis on the `A w j` is needed: when `A w j = ∅`
the `uniform` clause is never invoked, and `optHitTestPMF_relErr_hitProb` applies
with a vacuous hypothesis. -/
