# Almost-uniform sampling when the solution *type* moves with the instance

`IsFPAUS size g A` (`Arlib.Approximation.Counting`) is stated for
`g : α → Finset Ω` and `A : α → ℝ → PMF (Option Ω × ℕ)` with **one** `Ω`, fixed
before the instance is named.  That is the right definition for a sampling
problem whose solutions all live in one universe of objects — satisfying
assignments of a propositional formula, spanning trees of a graph — and it is
wrong for a *family* of problems whose solution objects are typed by the
instance.  The two symptoms are the same fact seen from either side:

* a family of conjunctive queries whose **constant domain** grows has answers in
  `List (C m)`, a type that moves with `m`, so it is not an `IsFPAUS` instance
  family at all;
* a family of tree automata whose **label alphabet** grows has accepted trees in
  `LTree (Γ m)`, and the usual repair is to *tag*: replace `Γ m` by
  `Σ m, Γ m` and push every solution set forward along the tag.  Tagging works,
  and it is noise.

This module removes both symptoms at once, by making the solution type a
function of the instance.

## The definition

```
structure IsFPAUSDep {α : Type u} {Ω : α → Type v} (size : α → ℕ)
    (g : (w : α) → Finset (Ω w)) (A : (w : α) → ℝ → PMF (Option (Ω w) × ℕ)) : Prop
```

with the *same three clauses*, read in the fibre over `w`.  Nothing about the
content changes: `uniform` still pins `Pr[output = x]` inside
`[(1-δ)/|g w|, (1+δ)/|g w|]` for every `x ∈ g w`, `empty` still forces `none` on
an instance with no solutions, and `polytime` is verbatim the same inequality
between natural numbers.  This is possible because every clause of `IsFPAUS`
already quantifies over `w` first and mentions `Ω` only *underneath* that
quantifier — the fixed `Ω` was never load-bearing, only convenient.

**The constant case is not a special case by fiat**: `isFPAUS_iff_dep` is an
`Iff`, and it holds by `Iff.rfl` up to reassembling the three fields.  So
`IsFPAUSDep` is a generalisation of `IsFPAUS` in the strict sense — every
existing consumer of `IsFPAUS` may be read as a consumer of the dependent form
at a constant family and *vice versa*, and no existing theorem changes meaning.

## Tagging is subsumed, exactly

`isFPAUSDep_iff_tagged` is the sharp statement about the workaround.  Given
**any** family of embeddings `tag w : Ω w ↪ T` into a single type `T`,

    IsFPAUSDep size g A  ↔  IsFPAUS size (fun w => (g w).map (tag w)) (tagAlg tag A)

— an `Iff`, for an arbitrary injective tagging, with no hypothesis relating the
`tag w` to each other.  So the tagged statement and the dependent statement have
the same content: a development that tagged its solutions lost nothing and
gained nothing, and may now stop.  `sigmaEmb` is the canonical tagging, into
`Σ w, Ω w`, and `isFPAUSDep_iff_tagged_sigma` is the corollary; but the general
form is what applies to a development that tagged by something *coarser* than
the instance — an index `m` rather than the instance itself, which is the shape
a `Σ`-family actually produces.

The `Iff` is what makes this a subsumption rather than a convenience.  A one-way
implication would leave open that the tagged form is strictly stronger, i.e.
that a tagged sampler must additionally be uniform *across* fibres.  It is not:
`uniform` only ever compares `Pr[output = x]` with `|g w|` at a single `w`.

## What does **not** need the same treatment: `IsFPRAS`

An FPRAS returns a *number*.  Its output type is `ℝ` — written into the
definition, not a parameter — so there is no `Ω` to make depend on the instance,
and a family of counting problems whose solution objects move is still a family
of `α → ℝ` for one moving `α`, which a `Σ`-type already handles with no new
definition.  `isFPRAS_no_dependent_output` records this as a triviality one can
point at rather than as prose: the counting analogue of `isFPAUS_iff_dep` is the
identity, because `IsFPRAS size f A` never mentions a solution type.  A
`IsFPRASDep` would be `IsFPRAS` with a phantom parameter, and is not built here.

## What is ported, and what is not

* `IsFPAUSDep.comp_bijection` — the transfer theorem, with source and target
  solution types **both** moving.  Same proof as `IsFPAUS.comp_bijection`;
  `decodeOpt` needs only that `Ω₁ w` and `Ω₂ (h w)` lie in a common universe,
  which they do fibrewise.
* `IsFPAUSDep.PinnedTime`, with `polytime`, `weaken`, `exists_pinnedTime`,
  `of_pinnedTime`, `pinnedTime_of_cost_zero`, and the pinned transfer theorems
  `comp_bijection_pinned_on` / `comp_bijection_pinned`.  All of these are
  statements about the *second* component of the output pair, which is `ℕ` in
  every fibre, so none of them notices that `Ω` moved.
* `IsFPAUSDep.Charges`, with `not_cost_zero` and `map_add`.  Likewise.

**Not ported, and why.**  `Arlib.Approximation.Sampling`'s `PreprocessedSampler`
assembly is *not* restated here.  Its hypotheses include a polynomial bound on
`Real.log (g w).card` and a retry loop whose failure probability is measured
against one fixed `Ω`; the assembly itself would go through fibrewise, but every
one of its inputs (`retrySampler`, `between_of_abs_sub_le`, `outProbR_retryPMF`)
is a statement about a *single* `PMF` on a *single* type and is therefore
already applicable in a fibre without any dependent restatement.  Restating them
would duplicate a hundred lemmas to change nothing.  The rule is: a lemma that
quantifies over instances needs the dependent form; a lemma about one run does
not.

`ParsimoniousReduction` and `PinnedReduction` are likewise not given dependent
twins.  They bundle a counting datum (`f w = g (toFun w)`, on `ℝ`) with a
sampling datum, and the counting half is already universe-blind; a caller whose
solution types move takes `IsFPRAS.comp_parsimonious` and
`IsFPAUSDep.comp_bijection` separately, which is what
`CQCount.Capstone.KDomain` does.

## Main results

* `IsFPAUSDep` — the definition.
* `isFPAUS_iff_dep` — the constant case, as an `Iff`.
* `isFPAUSDep_iff_tagged`, `isFPAUSDep_iff_tagged_sigma` — tagging is subsumed.
* `IsFPAUSDep.comp_bijection`, `.comp_bijection_pinned_on`,
  `.comp_bijection_pinned` — transfer along a bijective reduction.
* `IsFPAUSDep.PinnedTime`, `IsFPAUSDep.Charges` and their API.
* `isFPRAS_no_dependent_output` — the negative on the counting side.

`outProbR_map` is stated in `Counting` inside a section with

*same* universe.  Every use in the library satisfies that, and the tagging
theorem below does not: `Ω w : Type v` is tagged into `Σ w : α, Ω w :
Type (max u v)`.  The statement is added here rather than by loosening the

/-! ## The dependent definition -/

/-- **A fully polynomial-time almost-uniform sampler for a family of solution
sets whose ambient type moves with the instance.**

`Ω : α → Type v` gives each instance its own solution type; `g w : Finset (Ω w)`
its solution set; `A w δ : PMF (Option (Ω w) × ℕ)` the joint law of the
sampler's output and step count in that fibre.  The three clauses are
`IsFPAUS`'s, read fibrewise, and say exactly what `IsFPAUS`'s say — see
`isFPAUS_iff_dep`, which is an `Iff` at a constant `Ω`.

Nothing here is uniform *across* fibres except the two constants of `polytime`,
and that is deliberate: those constants are the entire content of "polynomial
time in the instance size", and letting them vary with the instance would empty
the clause. -/

/-! ## The constant case

The point of this section is that `IsFPAUSDep` is a *generalisation* and not a
neighbouring notion.  The `Iff` is what protects every existing consumer of
`IsFPAUS`: a theorem stated in either form may be used in the other. -/

/-- **`IsFPAUS` is `IsFPAUSDep` at a constant family, on the nose.**

An `Iff`, not an implication in either direction: the three clauses are the same
propositions, and the proof is reassembling the fields.  Consequently no theorem
about `IsFPAUS` becomes weaker or stronger when read through `IsFPAUSDep`, and a
development may migrate one statement at a time. -/

/-! ## Tagging is subsumed

The workaround for a moving solution type is to embed every fibre into one type
and push the solution sets forward.  The theorems here say that the workaround
changes nothing: the tagged `IsFPAUS` statement and the untagged `IsFPAUSDep`
statement are *equivalent*, for an arbitrary family of embeddings. -/

For *any* family of embeddings `tag w : Ω w ↪ T` into a single type — no
relation between the `tag w` assumed — the tagged `IsFPAUS` statement and the
dependent statement are equivalent.

Read left to right this says the dependent form is at least as strong as any
tagging.  Read right to left it says a development that tagged proved nothing
extra: in particular a tagged sampler is *not* additionally required to be
uniform across fibres, since `IsFPAUS.uniform` compares `Pr[output = x]` only
with `|g w|` at the single `w` that produced `x`.  Both directions matter, and
together they say the tagging device is content-free. -/

/-! ## Transporting a dependent FPAUS along a bijective reduction

Both solution types move: the source's with the source instance, the target's
with the target instance.  Nothing in the proof of `IsFPAUS.comp_bijection`
noticed which type it was working in — `decodeOpt` and `decodeOpt_preimage_some`
are statements in a fibre — so the script is unchanged. -/

The datum is a family of bijections `e w : ↥(g₁ w) ≃ ↥(g₂ (h w))`, exactly as in
`IsFPAUS.comp_bijection`, except that now the two sides of each bijection live
in types that both depend on the instance.  All three clauses transfer without
loss in `δ`.

The one universe constraint is that `Ω₁ w` and `Ω₂ v` lie in a common universe —
needed by `decodeOpt`, which is a map between two solution types at a *fixed*

/-! ## Satisfiability, and what it costs

`IsFPAUSDep` must not be a predicate nothing satisfies — and it must not be one
*everything* satisfies for a bad reason.  `exists_isFPAUSDep` settles the first:
the sampler that draws exactly uniformly from `g w` at cost `0` is an
`IsFPAUSDep` for **every** solution family whatever, moving type included.  That
is the dependent twin of `CQCount.Capstone.exists_isFPAUS`, and it is the second
point too: the object it exhibits is precisely the zero-cost non-algorithm that
`pinnedTime_of_cost_zero` describes and `Charges` excludes.  So the theorem is a
satisfiability certificate and explicitly **not** an algorithm; a hypothesis of
the form `IsFPAUSDep size g B` is free in this cost model exactly as
`IsFPAUS size g B` is.

A *non-degenerate* instance — a family whose solution sets are nonempty and
whose solution type genuinely moves — is `CQCount.Capstone.KDomain.GrowC`, which
needs a source of real instances and so lives in the sibling repository. -/

at `(c, d) = (1, 0)`.  The dependent twin of `CQCount.Capstone.exists_isFPAUS`,
with the same reading: an `IsFPAUSDep` hypothesis on the target of a reduction is
**free**, and a theorem proved through one says something about the reduction,
not about the existence of an algorithm. -/

/-! ## The counting side needs nothing

Stated as a theorem rather than as prose, so that a reader who wonders whether
`IsFPRAS` was also frozen can be shown the answer instead of told it. -/

/-- **`IsFPRAS` has no solution type to make dependent.**

The statement is deliberately a triviality: `IsFPRAS size f A` is `Iff.rfl` to
itself after abstracting an arbitrary family of types `Ω : α → Type v`, because
no clause of `IsFPRAS` mentions `Ω`.  An FPRAS returns a real number, and `ℝ`
does not move with the instance.

Consequently there is **no** `IsFPRASDep` in this module.  A family of counting
problems whose solution objects move is already an `IsFPRAS` over the `Σ`-type
of instances, with no new definition and no tagging — which is exactly what
`CQCount.Capstone.KAtoms.StarPath.fpras_starFam` and
`CQCount.Capstone.KDomain.fprasD_fam` do.  Building a symmetric-looking
`IsFPRASDep` with a phantom parameter would suggest a difficulty that does not
exist. -/
