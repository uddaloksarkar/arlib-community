# [GKY22, §4]: sparse set disjointness — Razborov's covering family, and the UFA bound

Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's separation (`lem: separation`, §4,
[GKY22, `lem:separation`]) rests on two facts about
`Disj^n_k = {(S,T) : |S| = |T| = k, S ∩ T = ∅}`, pulling in opposite directions:

* **Upper bound.** Polynomially many sets `Z₁, …, Z_ℓ ⊆ [n]` suffice so that
  *every* disjoint pair `(S,T)` is *separated* by some `Z_i` — `S ⊆ Z_i` and
  `Z_i ∩ T = ∅` ([GKY22, §4.1]).  An NFA can then guess `i`.
* **Lower bound.** `Par₁` of the disjointness matrix is at least `C(n,k)`
  ([GKY22, §4.1]), so no *unambiguous* automaton is small.

Both are here.  The NFA construction that consumes the first is not; see the
closing section.

## Counting, not probability ([GKY22, §4.1])

The paper's covering family comes from the probabilistic method: a uniform
random `Z` separates a fixed pair with probability `2^{-2k}`, so `ℓ` independent
draws miss it with probability `(1 − 2^{-2k})^ℓ < e^{-2^{-2k}ℓ}`, and a union
bound over the fewer than `C(n,k)²` pairs finishes it.

Formalized here as a **count of families**, with no probability space anywhere.
This is the same decision `LowerBounds/ClaimPerm.lean` records for its
second-moment argument, and the reasons are the same: every step is already a
statement about cardinalities of `Finset`s, an ambient measure would have to be
divided out again at the end, and `Fintype.piFinset` computes the number of bad
families on the nose.  Concretely, `exists_sepFamily` shows

  `#{bad families} ≤ #Pairs · (2ⁿ − 2^{n−2k})^ℓ < (2ⁿ)^ℓ = #{all families}`

and reads a good family off the strict inequality.  Nothing is lost: the
probabilistic argument *is* this count, divided by `(2ⁿ)^ℓ`.

## A different `ℓ`, and why

The paper takes `ℓ = ⌈2^{2k}·ln C(n,k)²⌉`.  We take

  `sepFamilySize n k = 2^{2k}·(2n+1)`,

which for the paper's `k = ⌈log₂ n⌉` is `O(n³)` against the paper's
`O(n² log² n)` — both polynomial, which is all `lem: separation` needs, and the
exponent is explicit rather than hidden in a `Ω`-sign (`docs/dev/Automata-ROADMAP.md` §5).

The gain is that no logarithm and no real-valued rounding ever appear.  Two
replacements do it.  First, the union bound is taken over `4ⁿ` rather than over
`C(n,k)²`: a cruder count of pairs, but one that needs no binomial identity.
Second — and this is the only genuinely analytic step in the file — the decay
`(1 − 2^{-2k})^ℓ` is replaced by iterating the *integer* Bernoulli inequality

  `2·(q−1)^q ≤ q^q`  for `q ≥ 2`  (`two_mul_pred_pow_le`),

which says that `q` rounds cost a factor of two.  Taking `t = 2n+1` rounds of
`q = 2^{2k}` therefore beats `4ⁿ < 2^{2n+1}`.  The whole argument then lives in
`ℕ`, except for eight lines inside `two_mul_pow_le_succ_pow` where Mathlib's
`one_add_mul_le_pow` is applied over `ℝ` and cast back.

**What surprised us.**  The sharp constant matters.  `2·(q−1)^q ≤ q^q` is true
for every `q ≥ 2` but has *no* slack to spare in the limit — the ratio tends to
`2/e ≈ 0.736` — and the naive weakenings one reaches for first (`q = 2`: `4 ≥ 2`;
`(q/(q−1))² ≥ 2`) are false from `q = 4` on.  There is no cheaper decay
estimate; `e` really is in the way, and Bernoulli is the shortest route past it.

## The full-rank fact is imported, and it is the only thing that is

[GKY22, §4.1] cites Kushilevitz–Nisan, Example 2.12, for
`rank(F) = C(n,k)`.  That is not a small fact: the disjointness matrix on
`k`-subsets is a member of the Johnson scheme whose nonsingularity for `n ≥ 2k`
is equivalent to a theorem of Gottlieb on inclusion matrices, and the standard
proof computes the `k+1` eigenvalues `(−1)^i C(n−k−i, k−i)`.  Nothing in Mathlib
is close to it.

Following `docs/dev/Automata-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 and `LowerBounds/Imported.lean`, it enters as a
**one-field structure**, `DisjFullRank`, and never as an `axiom` — and, as
there, the structure is *inhabited* (`disjFullRank_zero`) so that every theorem
conditional on it is known not to be vacuous.

Two things are deliberately *not* imported alongside it, because they are
provable here and the import should be as small as possible.

* `rk⁺ ≥ rk` — `card_le_of_hasNNRankLE` derives it from Mathlib's matrix rank:
  a nonnegative rank-`r` factorization is in particular a factorization through
  `Fin r`, so `rank ≤ r`, while nonsingularity forces `rank = C(n,k)`.  The
  nonnegativity of the vectors is never used, which is exactly right: the bound
  `Par₁ ≥ rk⁺ ≥ rk` loses nothing by forgetting signs.
* `Par₁ ≥ rk⁺` — that is `hasNNRankLE_of_hasTPPartition`, already in
  `Arlib/Communication/TwoParty.lean`.

So the conditional chain is `DisjFullRank → Par₁(F) ≥ C(n,k) → (n/k)^k`, with
one hypothesis and two proved links.

## `Par₁` as an `sInf`, and the junk value

`tpPar` is a `sInf` over `ℕ`, so it is `0` when no partition exists at all, and
a lower bound on it would then be false.  `disjHasTPPartition` removes the
worry once and for all by exhibiting a partition of *any* two-party function on
*finite* types into `|X × Y|` singleton rectangles.  It is a crude partition and
it is meant to be: its only job is to make the infimum an infimum over a
nonempty set.

## The NFAs are not here

`lem: separation` also asserts `n^{O(1)}`-state NFAs for `⟨Disj^n_k⟩` and its
complement ([GKY22, §4.1]).  They are not formalized.  The covering
family they need is `exists_sepFamily`, which is here; what is missing is the
encoding `⟨S⟩⟨T⟩ ∈ {0,1}^{2n}` of a pair as a *word*, together with the state
count of the automaton that guesses `i ∈ [ℓ]` and then verifies `S ⊆ Z_i` and
`Z_i ∩ T = ∅` letter by letter.  That is a self-contained piece of work on
`Automata/Basic.lean`'s `NFA`, and it feeds only the *upper* bound half of the
separation, which carries none of the quantitative content.

least `n/k`, which in `ℕ` is the cleared inequality `n·(k−i) ≤ k·(n−i)`.  Both

disjoint `k`-subsets `(S,T)` has some `Z_i` with `S ⊆ Z_i` and `Z_i ∩ T = ∅`.

The proof counts *families* `Fin ℓ → Finset (Fin n)`: for each of the at most
`4ⁿ` pairs, the families that fail it are a `piFinset` of size
`(2ⁿ − 2^{n−2k})^ℓ`, and `4ⁿ · (2ⁿ − 2^{n−2k})^ℓ < (2ⁿ)^ℓ` by
`pow_mul_lt_pow`.  So the union of the bad sets is not everything.

Two degenerate cases are dispatched first and cost nothing: for `k = 0` the
empty set separates every pair, and for `2k > n` there are no disjoint pairs of
`k`-sets at all. -/

`Matrix.rank_mul_le_right` bounds the rank by `r` while `Matrix.rank_of_isUnit`

/-- **I — the sparse disjointness matrix is nonsingular**
[IMPORTED — Kushilevitz–Nisan, Example 2.12, quoted at
[GKY22, §4.1]].

*The `C(n,k) × C(n,k)` matrix `[S ∩ T = ∅]` on `k`-subsets of `[n]` has full
rank.*

This is the sole hypothesis of the lower-bound half of [GKY22, §4], and it is a genuine
theorem: the matrix lies in the Johnson association scheme, its nonsingularity
for `n ≥ 2k` is equivalent to Gottlieb's theorem on inclusion matrices, and the
standard proof diagonalizes it with eigenvalues `(−1)^i·C(n−k−i, k−i)`.  Per
`docs/dev/Automata-ROADMAP.md` §1.3 it is a hypothesis and never an `axiom`; `disjFullRank_zero`
shows the hypothesis is about something.

Stated as invertibility of the determinant rather than as `rank = C(n,k)`
because that is the weakest form from which the rank statement follows
(`Matrix.rank_of_isUnit`), and because it is what a proof of the imported
theorem would naturally produce. -/
structure DisjFullRank (n k : ℕ) : Prop where
  /-- The determinant of the communication matrix is invertible in `ℝ`. -/
  isUnit_det : IsUnit (disjMatrix n k).det

/-- **`DisjFullRank` is satisfiable.**

The witness is `k = 0`, for any `n`: there is exactly one `0`-subset, the matrix
is the `1 × 1` matrix `[1]`, and `C(n,0) = 1`, so the bound it yields is the
correct one for that instance.  As in `LowerBounds/Imported.lean`, this is a
consistency check on the *shape* of the bundle and says nothing about the
interesting content — that the matrix stays nonsingular as `k` grows, which is
precisely what is imported. -/

Its only purpose is to make `tpPar` an infimum over a nonempty set, so that a
