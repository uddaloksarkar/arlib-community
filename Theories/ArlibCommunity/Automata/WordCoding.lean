# Coding a gadget composition as a word cut in half

The one genuinely new construction the automata lower bounds need, and the only
step of Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's §2 and §3 that their text does not perform at all —
it is hidden inside the sentence "we tacitly identify a function
`F : {0,1}^{m₁} × {0,1}^{m₂} → {0,1}` with the language
`F⁻¹(1) = {xy | F(x,y) = 1}`" ([GKY22, §2.1]).

## The mismatch

The composed function `f ∘ g^κ` of `Arlib/Communication/Gadget.lean` is a function of
the variables `Gadget.Var κ b = Fin 2 × κ × Fin b`, and the two parties are the
two values of the *first* component: `Gadget.alice` is `{v | v.1 = 0}`.  That is
a `VarPartition`, and the lifting theorem that is imported
(`Automata/Imported.lean`) speaks about covers of that partition.

An automaton, on the other hand, reads a word and the cut is at a *position*:
Alice holds a prefix, Bob a suffix, which is the `TPRect` model of
`Arlib/Communication/TwoParty.lean`.  Alice's variables are not a contiguous block of
positions — they are interleaved with Bob's, one gadget at a time — so the two
models are genuinely different and something has to be built.

This file builds it: an injection `idx` of `Gadget.Var κ b` into
`Fin (half + half)` sending Alice's variables onto the first `half` positions and
Bob's onto the last `half`, together with

* `assignOf`, turning a pair of half-words into an assignment;
* `aliceWord` / `bobWord`, the inverse, turning an assignment into a pair of
  half-words;
* `encDNF`, the same renaming applied to a DNF, so that a `DNF (Gadget.Var κ b)`
  becomes the `DNF (Fin n)` that `Automata/DNFtoUFA.lean` compiles;
* and the two **transport** theorems, which take a cover (resp. a partition) of a
  fibre in the word model and produce one in the variable-partition model.

The transports are what a lower bound is consumed through.  They go in the
direction "two-party ⟹ variable-partition", which is the useful one: the
imported theorem says *no small cover exists* on the variable-partition side, so
a small cover on the word side would produce one and is therefore impossible.

## Why an `Equiv` is not needed, and what is used instead

The obvious design is an equivalence `Gadget.Var κ b ≃ Fin (half + half)`.  It
exists, but nothing below needs it: `idx` is used only to *read* a letter of the
word, and `(coord κ b).symm` is used only to *write* one.  Asking for a
two-sided inverse on the nose would mean proving `Fin`-arithmetic round trips
that `assignOf_aliceWord_bobWord` obtains for free from
`Equiv.symm_apply_apply` on the smaller equivalence `κ × Fin b ≃ Fin half`.
So the coding is presented as that smaller equivalence plus a side bit, which is
also how one would describe it on paper.

`coord` is `Fintype.equivFin` retyped along `card (κ × Fin b) = card κ * b`, and
is therefore **noncomputable**; so is everything downstream of it.  Nothing in
the development evaluates an automaton, so this costs nothing — the same
observation `Automata/Simulation.lean` makes about `NFA.simFamily`.

## The surprise: the paper's product construction is unnecessary

The last step of the proof of `thm:complement`
([GKY22, §2.2]) reads:

> Any NFA that recognizes `{0,1}* ∖ L(A)` can be transformed into an NFA that
> recognizes `F⁻¹(0) = {0,1}^{2bn} ∖ L(A)` by taking a product with a DFA that
> has `2bn + 2` states.  It follows that any NFA that recognizes `{0,1}* ∖ L(A)`
> has at least `2^{Ω̃(k²)} / (2bn + 2)` states.

That product, and the resulting division of the bound by `2bn + 2`, is needed
only because the paper's `lem:NFA-CC` is stated for an automaton whose language
is *exactly* `F⁻¹(1)`, so an automaton for the complement of `L(A)` in `{0,1}*`
accepts extra words of other lengths and is not directly admissible.
`Automata/Simulation.lean` deliberately weakened that hypothesis to constrain the
automaton **only on split words** `x ++ y` of the prescribed lengths (see its
"`WordsOfLen`, and the shape of the hypothesis" section).  Under that hypothesis
an automaton for the full complement is admissible as it stands, no length
counter is needed, and the lower bound in `Automata/Complement.lean` is the
lifting bound on the nose rather than that bound divided by `2bn + 2`.

## Fibres of a negated function

`Automata/Simulation.lean` produces covers of the fibre `true`.  What the
complementation argument needs is a cover of the fibre `false` of the *original*
function, obtained by running the simulation on `fun x y => !(F x y)`.
`tpFiber_not_true` is the one-line identification of the two, and it is stated as
an equality of predicates rather than an `Iff` so that it can be rewritten under
the binder of `TPCovers`.

Stated as an equality rather than a pointwise `Iff` because it is used to rewrite

This is how a lower bound on `Cov₀(F)` is turned into a lower bound on the number
of states of an NFA for the *complement* language: the automaton for the
complement accepts `x ++ y` exactly when `!(F x y)`, so `NFA.hasTPCover_of_nfa`
applies to `¬F` and delivers a cover of `F⁻¹(0)`
([GKY22, §2.2]). -/

/-- **One party's word length**: one bit per (coordinate of `f`, bit of the
gadget) pair.  The paper's `bn` ([GKY22, §2.2]),
with `n = |κ|`.

An `abbrev` rather than a `def` so that `Fin (half κ b + half κ b)` and
`Fin (Fintype.card κ * b + Fintype.card κ * b)` are the same type up to
reducible unfolding; `Fin.castAdd` and `Fin.natAdd` produce the latter shape and
every statement below wants the former. -/

/-- **The position of a composed variable in the word**: Alice's variables — those
on side `0` — go to the first `half` positions, Bob's to the last `half`.

This is the map that makes the paper's identification of `F` with a language
precise.  It is injective (`Fin.castAdd` and `Fin.natAdd` have disjoint ranges,
and `coord` is a bijection), but injectivity is never needed: every use reads a
letter at position `idx v`, and the round trip `assignOf_aliceWord_bobWord` is
proved by case analysis on the side rather than by inverting. -/

Note that this is `DNFtoUFA.assign (x ++ y) ∘ idx` by definition, which is

`idx` and then reading it with `DNFtoUFA.assign` is the same as reading the
