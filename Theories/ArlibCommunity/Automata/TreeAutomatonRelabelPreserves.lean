# What the alphabet re-indexing leaves alone

`Arlib.Automata.TreeAutomatonRelabel` builds `relabelTo A Λ`, `restrictAlphabet A`
and `presentation A`, and proves the one thing a *counting* statement needs: the
size slices are in bijection, hence equinumerous
(`bijOn_langOfSize_relabelTo`, `ncard_langOfSize_presentation`).

A *sampling* statement needs two more things, and they are what this file
supplies.  Both are about data that the re-indexing must not disturb if a
theorem stated for the original automaton is to be quoted for the re-indexed one
and back again.

## 1.  Binarity is invariant

`LTree.IsBinary` (`Arlib.Automata.TreeAutomatonBinarize`) is the paper's
`Trees_b[Σ]`: every node has `0` or `2` children.  It is a condition on the
*shape* of a tree and `LTree.mapLabel` changes only the *labels*, so it is
preserved in both directions — `isBinary_mapLabel_iff`.

The `iff` is what is wanted, not either half alone.  The forward direction sends
a binary tree of the re-indexed alphabet to a binary tree of the original one;
the backward direction is the one a caller needs when the binarity hypothesis is
available downstream — on `L_n(A)` — and has to be re-established upstream, on
`L_n(relabelTo A Λ)`, which is where the re-indexed automaton's own theorems
want it.  Neither direction assumes anything about `f`: injectivity is
irrelevant, because no node is created or destroyed.

## 2.  The size data is unchanged

For a `#TA` instance the natural size measure is `|S_reach| + |Σ_used| + n`, and
re-indexing must not inflate it or a polynomial-time claim transported across
the re-indexing would say something weaker than it appears to.  It does not:

* `ncard_reachableStates_relabelTo` — the reachable states are literally the
  same set (`reachableStates_relabelTo`), so their `ncard` is the same.  The
  hypothesis `A.usedLabels ⊆ Λ` is the one that hypothesis is always used with;
  without it `relabelTo` can only *lose* transitions, and the count can drop.
* `ncard_usedLabels_restrictAlphabet` — the used letters of `restrictAlphabet A`
  are *all* of `↥A.usedLabels` (`usedLabels_restrictAlphabet`), whose `Nat.card`
  is `A.usedLabels.ncard`.  So the alphabet count is preserved on the nose, not
  merely bounded.

Both are one-line consequences of results already in `TreeAutomatonRelabel`; they
are stated here rather than left to the caller because the second passes through
`Set.ncard_univ` and `Nat.card_coe_set_eq`, which is exactly the step a
caller is likely to get wrong (the used labels of the re-indexed automaton are
`Set.univ` in the *subtype*, not the original set).

## Main results

* `LTree.isBinary_mapLabel`, `LTree.isBinary_of_isBinary_mapLabel`,
  `LTree.isBinary_mapLabel_iff` — binarity is invariant under relabelling.
* `TreeAutomaton.ncard_reachableStates_relabelTo`,
  `TreeAutomaton.ncard_usedLabels_restrictAlphabet` — the two counts a `#TA`
  size measure is built from survive the re-indexing unchanged.
