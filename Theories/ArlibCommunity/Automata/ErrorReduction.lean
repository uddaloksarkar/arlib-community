# `∨` is cheap to approximate at error `1/4`

Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's bonus result (`thm: error`, §5,
[GKY22, §5]) says that approximate nonnegative
rank is *wildly* non-monotone in the error parameter: there is a matrix whose
`10⁻⁵`-approximate nonnegative rank is `2^Ω̃(m²)` while its `1/4`-approximate
nonnegative rank is only `2^O(m)`.  The hard half — the `10⁻⁵` lower bound — is
[GKY22, §3]'s machinery.  This file supplies the *easy* half, and it really is easy: it
is a three-line calculation in the paper ([GKY22, §5]) whose entire
content is that the arithmetic mean of two bits is never more than `1/4` away
from their `∨`, once shifted by `1/4`.

## What is formalized, and what is not

The paper states the idea twice: once for nonnegative *degree*, as `cl: or`
([GKY22, `cl:or`]), and once for nonnegative *rank*, in the closing
paragraph ([GKY22, §5]).  Only the second is here.  The first lives on
the one-party side — conical juntas over `{0,1}^n` — which is
`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/LowerBounds/ConicalJunta.lean`'s territory, not this area's, and the two
statements have literally the same proof.  Formalizing the rank version alone is
therefore not a shortcut: it is the version the theorem consumes.

Nothing here mentions the hard function.  Every statement is generic in
`F : X → Y → Bool` over arbitrary types, so that the coordinator can instantiate
it at [GKY22, §3]'s `F` with no further work, and so that the two halves of `thm: error`
stay textually independent.

## The three closure lemmas, and why they are worth having

The paper writes `rk⁺(G) ≤ 2·rk⁺(F) + 1` and leaves the reader to see it.  Seen
in Lean, `G` is built from `F` by exactly three moves:

* **pullback** along `(x,x') ↦ x` and `(y,y') ↦ y` — nonnegative rank does not
  increase when rows and columns are duplicated and permuted, because the
  witnessing vectors are simply precomposed;
* **nonnegative scaling** by `1/2`, absorbed into the left vectors;
* **addition**, which concatenates the two witnessing families — this is the
  only place an index type is genuinely rebuilt, and `Fin.addCases` /
  `Fin.sum_univ_add` do it;
* plus the constant `1/4`, of nonnegative rank `1`.

So `nnRankLE_comp`, `nnRankLE_smul_left`, `nnRankLE_add` and `nnRankLE_const`
are stated separately and the bound `r + r + 1` falls out by counting.  They are
generic facts about `HasNNRankLE` that `Arlib/Communication/TwoParty.lean` does not
carry; they are kept here rather than pushed upstream because this is the only
consumer so far, and because that file is owned by the general theory rather
than by this paper.

## `HasApproxNNRankLE` first, `anRank` second

The headline is stated twice.  `hasApproxNNRankLE_orExtend` takes an explicit
factorization of `F` and produces an explicit one for `F^∨`; `anRank_orExtend_le`
is the `sInf` form, `rk⁺_{1/4}(F^∨) ≤ 2·rk⁺(F) + 1`.  The second needs the
hypothesis that `F` has *some* finite nonnegative-rank factorization, and that
is not pedantry: `nnRank` is a `sInf` over a set that is genuinely empty for
some matrices on infinite index types (the identity matrix on `ℕ × ℕ`, say), and
`sInf ∅ = 0` in `ℕ` would turn the conclusion into the false claim
`rk⁺_{1/4}(F^∨) ≤ 1`.  This is the junk-value trap that
`Arlib/Communication/TwoParty.lean` documents, met here for the first time in this
area.

## One thing that surprised us

The `1/4` is not slack.  `G` takes the three values `1/4`, `3/4`, `5/4`, and the
target `F^∨` takes the values `0` and `1`; every one of the three cases attains
the error `1/4` *exactly*.  So `approximatesTP_orMatrix` is tight in all three
branches simultaneously, and no smaller error constant works for this `G`.  That
is a good sanity check on the transcription: a proof that went through with room
to spare would mean the shift had been misread.

/-! ## `thm: error` end to end

The two halves of `thm: error` ([GKY22, §1.2],
[GKY22, §5]) are about the *same* boolean matrix
`M = F^∨`, read at two different error levels:

* at `1/4`, `rk⁺` is small — at most `2·rk⁺(F) + 1`, which is the generic bound
  `anRank_orExtend_le` proved above;
* at `10⁻⁵`, `rk⁺` is huge — `2^{Ω̃(m²)}`, which is `thm: hard-or`, [GKY22, §3]'s
  machinery ([GKY22, §3]).

The upper half is proved here.  The lower half is **not**, and cannot be
assembled from what this repository has: [GKY22, §3]'s hardness is delivered as a lower
bound on the approximate nonnegative *degree* of the one-party `f^∨`
(`Arlib/KnowledgeCompilation/LowerBounds/ConicalJunta.lean`) and on `Par₁` in the variable-partition
model, never lifted to an approximate nonnegative *rank* statement about the
two-party `F^∨` at error `10⁻⁵`.  So, following `docs/dev/Automata-ROADMAP.md` §1.2 and the idiom
of `Imported.lean`, it enters as an imported, **inhabited** bundle `ErrorHard`,
and `error_reduction_gap` assembles the two halves into the gap the paper
states. -/

[IMPORTED — Göös–Kiefer–Yuan `thm: hard-or`, proved in
[GKY22, §3] and quoted at
[GKY22, §5]].

The bonus result needs one object `F : X → Y → Bool` that is pulled in opposite
directions:

* `rankBound` bounds `rk⁺(F)` from above — the paper's `nrank(F) ≤ 2^m`, which
  is what makes `F^∨` cheap at error `1/4` through `anRank_orExtend_le`;
* `lowerBound` bounds `rk⁺_{10⁻⁵}(F^∨)` from below — the paper's
  `anrank_{10⁻⁵}(F^∨) ≥ 2^{Ω̃(m²)}`, the content of [GKY22, §3].

Both are carried as explicit numbers rather than `2^m` / `2^{Ω̃(m²)}`, per
`docs/dev/Automata-ROADMAP.md` §5.  The `hard` field is what is genuinely imported; `nnRankLE` is
data the caller already possesses — a nonnegative factorization of `F`.
Non-vacuity is `errorHard_witness`; as in `Imported.lean` the witness pins only
the *shape*, not the `2^{Ω̃(m²)}` content. -/

`2·rankBound + 1` — which is exactly the paper's `2^{Ω̃(m²)}` against
`2^{m+1}+1` — this is the promised failure of error reduction; see
`anRank_lt_anRank_of_errorHard`.

This is a **derived** convenience: both halves are named on their own and this
statement is literally their pair.
