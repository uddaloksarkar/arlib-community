# Re-indexing the alphabet of a tree automaton

`Arlib.Automata.TreeAutomatonFinite` cuts an automaton down to its reachable
states, producing `TreeAutomaton.restrict A` on the genuinely `Finite` type
`↥A.reachableStates`, with `langOfSize_restrict` an *equality* of slices.  It
stops there, with the remark that

> The alphabet is not re-indexed.  Doing so would change the type of the trees,
> from `LTree Γ` to `LTree ↥A.usedLabels`, and so would change `langOfSize` from
> an equality into a bijection.

This file carries out that re-indexing, and the bijection is the point: the two
`langOfSize`s live in different types, so no equality is available and none is
claimed.  What is proved instead is that the label map

    LTree.mapLabel Subtype.val : LTree ↥Λ → LTree Γ

restricts to a **bijection** `L_n(relabelTo A Λ) → L_n(A)`, whence the equality of
`ncard`s that a counting statement needs.

## Why a bijection is available at all

Two facts, one in each direction.

*Injectivity* is soft: `Subtype.val` is injective, and `mapLabel` of an injective
map is injective (`mapLabel_injective`) — relabelling does not change the shape
of a tree, so nothing can be identified.

*Surjectivity* is the content, and it is exactly
`TreeAutomaton.labelsIn_of_mem_lang`, already proved: under `A.IsFinite k` no
accepted tree ever mentions a label outside `A.usedLabels`.  So every `t ∈ L(A)`
already *is* a `↥A.usedLabels`-labelled tree, in the precise sense that it lies in
the image of `mapLabel Subtype.val` (`LTree.exists_mapLabel_iff`: the image of
`mapLabel f` is the set of trees whose labels lie in `range f`).

Nothing about the transition relation is needed beyond this.  In particular no
"label monotonicity" hypothesis appears: `relabelTo A Λ` is defined by *reading*
the transitions of `A` at labels in `Λ`, so acceptance transports along
`mapLabel Subtype.val` in both directions unconditionally
(`accepts_relabelTo_iff`), and finiteness enters only to identify the image with
the whole of `L_n(A)`.

## No decidability is used

`relabelTo` is a plain reindexing of a `Prop`-valued relation, so neither
`DecidableEq Γ` nor `DecidablePred (· ∈ Λ)` is required anywhere below, and none
is introduced.  The `Fintype`s of `IsFinite.fintypeLabel` and
`TreeAutomaton.fintypeRestrictState` are `noncomputable`, obtained from
`Set.Finite.fintype`; a caller who wants *computable* enumeration must supply
decidability itself, but nothing here forces that on them.

## Main definitions

* `LTree.mapLabel f` — the functorial action of `f : Γ → Γ'` on labelled trees,
  with its `List` companion `LTree.mapLabelList`.
* `TreeAutomaton.relabelTo A Λ` — `A` read as an automaton over the alphabet
  `↥Λ`, for any `Λ : Set Γ`.
* `TreeAutomaton.restrictAlphabet A` — the case `Λ = A.usedLabels`.
* `TreeAutomaton.presentation A` — `relabelTo (restrict A) A.usedLabels`: the
  automaton on `↥A.reachableStates` over `↥A.usedLabels`, both `Fintype` under
  `IsFinite`.  This is the paper's enumerated tuple `(S, Σ, Δ, S₀)`.

## Main results

* `LTree.size_mapLabel`, `LTree.mapLabel_injective`, `LTree.exists_mapLabel_iff`
  — the functor, its injectivity and the characterisation of its image.
* `TreeAutomaton.accepts_relabelTo_iff` — acceptance transports both ways.
* `TreeAutomaton.bijOn_langOfSize_relabelTo` — **the bijection**
  `L_n(relabelTo A Λ) → L_n(A)`, for any `Λ` containing the used labels.
* `TreeAutomaton.ncard_langOfSize_relabelTo`,
  `TreeAutomaton.ncard_langOfSize_presentation` — the resulting count identity.
* `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite.relabelTo`, `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite.presentation` — the
  side conditions survive, so the presentation may be binarised, collapsed to a
  single initial state, or fed to any result stated for finite automata.

/-! #### Definition

`mapLabel` is a `mutual` block with a list-level companion, for the same reason
as `size` and `attachMap`: the recursive occurrence is nested under `List`, so
Lean infers neither structural nor well-founded recursion for a `ts.map` form. -/

mutual

/-- Relabel every node of a tree by `f`, leaving the shape untouched.  Unlike
`attachMap`, which relabels by a function of the *subtree*, this is the
functorial action of a map on the alphabet, and it is the map along which an
automaton over `↥Λ` is compared with an automaton over `Γ`. -/

/-! ### The full finite presentation -/

/-- **The paper's tuple `(S, Σ, Δ, S₀)`, as a `TreeAutomaton`.**

`restrict` re-indexes the states onto `↥A.reachableStates`; `relabelTo … usedLabels`
re-indexes the alphabet onto `↥A.usedLabels`.  Both carriers are `Fintype` under
`A.IsFinite k` (`fintypeRestrictState`, `IsFinite.fintypeLabel`), the arity bound
holds at every state of the type with no reachability side condition
(`presentation_step_length_le`), and the slice counts are unchanged
(`ncard_langOfSize_presentation`).

The order matters only for the *types*: `restrict` first keeps the alphabet
`A.usedLabels` — a set of labels of `A` itself — so the second step can be taken
at that very set, and `usedLabels_restrict_subset` is the containment it needs.
Taking the two steps in the other order would land the alphabet at
`↥(restrictAlphabet A).usedLabels`, which is the same set only up to a
transport. -/

genuinely finite types. -/
theorem IsFinite.presentation (h : A.IsFinite k) :
    (TreeAutomaton.presentation A).IsFinite k :=
  h.restrict.relabelTo _

/-- **The presentation counts the same thing.**

`|L_n(presentation A)| = |L_n(A)|` for every `n`.  The first factor is the
bijection `bijOn_langOfSize_relabelTo` — the alphabet re-indexing, whose slices
live in a *different tree type* and so can only be compared by a bijection — and
the second is `langOfSize_restrict`, the state re-indexing, which is an honest
equality of sets.

This is the identity that lets a counting result stated for an enumerated tuple
`(S, Σ, Δ, S₀)` be quoted for a `TreeAutomaton` on arbitrary carriers whose
reachable part is finite. -/
theorem ncard_langOfSize_presentation (h : A.IsFinite k) (n : ℕ) :

  rw [TreeAutomaton.presentation,
    ncard_langOfSize_relabelTo h.restrict usedLabels_restrict_subset n,
    langOfSize_restrict]

/-- Both carriers of the presentation are finite types: the states by
`finite_restrict_state`, the alphabet by `IsFinite.finite_label`.  The
corresponding `Fintype`s are `fintypeRestrictState` and
`IsFinite.fintypeLabel`. -/

/-- **The arity bound on the presentation needs no reachability hypothesis**, the
whole state type being reachable by construction.  Together with the two
`Fintype`s and `ncard_langOfSize_presentation` this is the complete tuple:
finite `S`, finite `Σ`, `Δ ⊆ S × Σ × (⋃_{i=0}^k S^i)`, and the same answer to
`#TA` at every `n`. -/
