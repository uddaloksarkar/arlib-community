# From an unambiguous DNF to a UFA

The one construction the complementation lower bound needs on the *upper* side.
Göös–Kiefer–Yuan spend a single paragraph on it
([GKY22, §2.2]):

> From `D` we obtain a UFA `A` that recognizes `F⁻¹(1) ⊆ {0,1}^{2bn}`, as
> follows.  Each initial state of `A` corresponds to a conjunction in `D`.  When
> reading the input `x ∈ {0,1}^{2bn}`, the UFA checks that the corresponding
> assignment to the variables satisfies the conjunction represented by the
> initial state.  This check requires at most `O(bn)` states for each initial
> state.  Thus, `A` has at most `n^{O(bk)}` states in total.

This file is that paragraph.  Variables are `Fin n`, the alphabet is `Bool`, and
an input word `w` of length `n` denotes the assignment `assign w = fun i => w[i]`
(the paper's `2bn` is our `n`; nothing in the construction cares where the
variable count came from).  `dnfUFA ψ` is the automaton, `dnfUFA_accepts_iff` is
"recognizes `ψ⁻¹(1)`", `dnfUFA_unambiguous` is the UFA property, and
`dnfUFA_card_state` is the state count — an *equality*, `ℓ * (n + 1)`, in place
of the paper's `O(bn)` per initial state.

## The states

A state is a pair `(t, j)` with `t : Fin ψ.length` the index of a term and
`j : Fin (n + 1)` a position in the word.  From `(t, j)` the letter `b` leads to
`(t, j + 1)` when `b` is consistent with what term `t` demands of variable `j`,
and nowhere otherwise.  Initial states are the `(t, 0)`, accepting states the
`(t, n)`.  So there are exactly `ψ.length` initial states, one per term, as the
paper says, and each one drags `n + 1` positions behind it.

Three consequences worth spelling out, because the paragraph above leaves all
three implicit.

**No sink state.**  `NFA.step` here is a *relation* (`Arlib/Automata/Basic.lean`,
"Transitions are relations, not functions"), so a forbidden letter simply has no
successor and the run dies.  A dead state would be harmless for the language but
fatal for the count-per-run bookkeeping: it would have to be shared between the
initial states, and then it would have to be non-accepting, and then it is one
extra state for nothing.  The bound is `ℓ * (n + 1)` on the nose, not
`ℓ * (n + 1) + 1`.

**Words of the wrong length are rejected, with no length test.**  Acceptance asks
for position exactly `n` after exactly `|w|` letters, and `isRun_last` says the
position after `|w|` letters is exactly `|w|`; so `|w| = n` is forced.  Longer
words are in fact rejected twice over — `Fin (n + 1)` has no room for a position
`n + 1`, so no run of length `> n` exists at all.

**Inconsistent terms contribute nothing.**  A term containing both `(x, true)`
and `(x, false)` is satisfied by no assignment
(`Term.not_sat_of_not_consistent`), and correspondingly `Allowed` fails for
*both* letters at position `x`: the run reaches position `x` and stops.  This is
why the construction needs no consistency hypothesis on `ψ`, which matters
because the paper's Step 1 builds terms by union and does not maintain one.

## Where unambiguity is spent, and a wrinkle the paper does not mention

Fix a word `w` of length `n`.  A run of `dnfUFA ψ` on `w` from `(t, 0)` is
*completely determined* by `t`: the `k`-th state has to be `(t, k)`
(`isRun_forced`).  So the accepting runs on `w` are in bijection with the terms
of `ψ` satisfied by `assign w`, and unambiguity of the automaton is exactly
unambiguity of the DNF.

The wrinkle: an accepting run is indexed by a *position* `t : Fin ψ.length`, not
by a term.  A `DNF` is a `List` (deliberately — see the module docstring of
`Circuits/DNF.lean`), so the same literal set may occur at two positions, and
then `Unambiguous.eq_of_sat`, which only concludes `ψ[t₁] = ψ[t₂]`, is *not*
enough: the two runs would start at different states and the automaton would be
ambiguous while the DNF's terms were pairwise distinguishable.

It turns out no extra hypothesis is needed, because `DNF.Unambiguous` is stated
by *counting* satisfied terms with multiplicity, and that form does rule out
repetition: two distinct positions both satisfied put two entries into
`ψ.satTerms α`, contradicting `length ≤ 1`.  `DNFtoUFA.index_unique` is that
argument, and `DNFtoUFA.two_le_countP` the combinatorial lemma under it.  Had
`Unambiguous` been the pairwise form, this file would have needed
`ψ.Nodup` as a hypothesis.  This is the one place where the choice made in
`Circuits/DNF.lean` is load-bearing rather than merely convenient.

## The bound is explicit

`Fintype.card (Fin ψ.length × Fin (n + 1)) = ψ.length * (n + 1)`.  For the
paper's application `ψ` is the `2bk`-DNF `D` with `n^{O(bk)}` terms over `2bn`
variables, giving `n^{O(bk)} * (2bn + 1)` states — the paper's `O(bn)` states per
initial state is our `n + 1`, and the constant is `1`.

/-! ## Words as assignments -/

/-- The assignment a word denotes: variable `i` gets the `i`-th letter.  Out of

below that uses it carries the hypothesis `w.length = n`, under which the

/-- **`Allowed t j b`**: the letter `b` at position `j` is consistent with the
term `t`.

Read as: no literal of `t` on the variable numbered `j` asks for the other
value.  A term that does not mention variable `j` allows both letters; a term
that mentions it once allows one; an *inconsistent* term, mentioning it with
both signs, allows neither — which is exactly how unsatisfiable terms are
killed, with no consistency hypothesis anywhere. -/

(`DNFtoUFA.Allowed`); there is no sink, an inconsistent letter simply kills the
run.  Every term index is initial at position `0` and accepting at position
`n`. -/
